zany witty funny stylish classic and masterful pulp fiction is my favourite film of all time its delivers its laughs through phenomenal performances from uma therman john trovolta quentin tarantino ving rhames bruce willis and samuel l jackson especially tarantino is one of the few film-making geniuses that hasnt graced the world with enough of his works his visual excellence and stylish storytelling techniques are on complete display in this film tarantino also gives us an ensemble of characters with flawed and yet unique personalities only tarantino characters have his characters are impressive and yet very flawed very human and yet each and every one of them manages to be ridiculously charismatic and witty the writing in this film is absolutely flawless providing one of the most quotable scripts in history pulp fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that manages to be both effective and enjoyableyoud certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence kids are used to that nowadays but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. forget horror ... if i was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity given i would understand it. once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you to say the least. shawshank redemption places a man in the wrong place at the wrong time early 1900s and in the worst kind of scenario. hes convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. this is how the movie starts. from this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the shawshank prison facility. logicly as a viewer you side for the andy dufresne beautifly interpreted by tim robbins. it doesnt really matter whether you think he did it or not ... hes stuck in there and it looks like hell be there for a while. friendships are born and enemies are made as you would expect. the way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships however is stunning. at the receiving end of one of those friendships is red redding morgen freeman a fellow inmate. red can get you anything and as andy red is serving a life sentence. lets just say they have the time to get to know each other learn from each other and eventually save each other. because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. if i had to condense this movie into a few words intelligence justice friendship being human redemption would all sound like understatements. saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. its just one youll have to watch if you love movies.you only have to watch pulp fiction to get that qt truly understands the meaning of the word: cool qts movies are all about tough guys and centerfold hot chicks who talk about pop culture movies and music but its his sense of language and prose that define his style like raymond chandler or elmore leonard he knows what great dialog sounds like and boy do these characters get a lot of cool things to talk about qts characters are masters at exhibiting great one-liners but theyre also alive with unique quirks and eccentricities mia is hip to knowing the difference between an elvis-man and a beatles-man jules winnfield exhibits a crude rough persona but can recognize a miracle when he sees one butch is a boxer who is as much of a hero as a he is a killer in a movie where the characters are defined by their self-referential discussions and kinetic personalities they are in fact the pulp to the fiction however pulp fiction may also be best known for its splendidly memorable moments that have become a part of popular culture in of themselves think about the dance off in jack rabbit slims its not great dancing but the moment is fun and playful or consider the most quoted scene of the film where jules and vincent talk about big macs theres something visceral and even moving about the films style qt seems to be lamenting his own taste and ideals on worldly topics in fact you can determine what his very soul is driven by at the core of his dialog but its also a film that lends itself to the laymens quality of life where the characters do and say things that relate to what people actually do and talk about and also lets not forget the nature of qts film making no other director has been so eagerly and shamelessly referenced in other films since steven spielberg some of qts best contemporaries are guy ritchie matthew vaughn and james gunn  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence you know what to expect. youve read all the reviews youve heard how good it is from your friends so you know what to expect. you already know that return of the king the third and final film in the amazing lord of the rings trilogy is an awesome and truly epic film experience. but for those who are still sceptical since lotr is such a nerdy enterprise im here to convince you to take a chance on this great film. first and foremost this movie is action-packed. yes the beginning is besides some murder and frightening scenes pretty peaceful. but when the armies of evil and the armies of men have fully gathered together at the awe-inspiring city of minas tirith thats when the fun begins. horses run over orks by the thousands giant mumakil elephants trample everybody and an army of ghosts show up and slaughter everything. to top it all off we have a showdown between warrior-princess eowyn and the undead leader of the nazgul the witch king and heck be darned if he isnt seriously scary enough to make hell freeze over with his voice alone. we also have legolas taking down an entire mumak singlehandedly. all this makes return truly entertaining to watch since the intensity and suspense has already been setup. but this film isnt only about slaughtering orcs: there are several different genres mashed up here. the freaky scenes where the giant spider shelob chases frodo through her lair bring to mind the creepier horror films from the 80s such as the thing. for any girls in the audience there is obviously the romance between aragorn and elven babe arwen and there is also eowyns feminist-style charge into the thick of battle. the point islotr was not made for creepy little nerds to obsess aboutyou know its really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess its not avatar where you get cgi things or these 3d animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. what makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie  the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made  but theres something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. count my words you will watch this movie that many times. its a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake. the movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry yet its not a depressing movie like schindlers list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump  its just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this is the best one.you dont go and see a tarantino written film without expecting to see guns gore vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence it is his style and he is a master at it the fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself this particular film was well written kudos to roger avary for helping tarantino the film is definitely oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots best picture best actor best supporting actor best supporting actress and best director to name a few unfortunately i believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards but tarantino and avary did get oscars for writing it their is talk about quarter pounders in france foot massages and what its like to kill a person if you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence rape and drug use you are probably a tarantino fan already finally who cares where tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans travolta jackson willis rames and thurman have my highest regards for a job well done i give the film a 10 out of 10 >you could look long and hard and never find a film more fun to watch than missionimpossible its classy stylish and heartpounding first let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot this is not true there are a few lines you shouldnt miss but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine ie dont wander off to get popcorn ethan hunt is an american agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team he strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents together they must prove that ethan was set up and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every american deep cover agent alive the story is well constructed without the typical action movie plot holes the film is well balanced between action and dialog but the best part of mi is ethan hunt whom tom cruise not only portrays but lives and defines a rare action hero with a brain ethan is quick fit savvy with both a computer and a gun driven and determined he thinks quick on his feet and doesnt look back but the most rare and valuable trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma he makes you like him and instead of coming across as arrogant his confidence and assurance draw you to him i almost never give a film a 1010 rating but missionimpossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right theres nothing to dislike and everything to enjoyhighly recommendedyou cant get more from a motion picture morgan freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinema. the movie have a great plot the director did a great job concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eye. shawshank redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance cant get better and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but its all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this. tim robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption.  so it comes down to the hobbits frodo and sam to bear the burden of the ring and deal with the treachery of gollum. after a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of mordor seeking to destroy the one ring in the place it was created the volcanic fires of mount doom.notably it won all eleven academy awards for which it was nominated an oscar record and tied for largest number of awards won with ben-hur and titanic. instead of starting just where the previous film left off however it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature gollum first came to possess the one ring. in this flashback actor andy serkis who voiced gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final cgi effects finally gets to appear on screen portraying gollums former self smê©agol. this disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned frodo who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the ring himself. thus the film returns to the present following frodo sam and gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of mordor. they pass by the terrifying dark city of minas morgul watching as the dreadful army of the witch king sets out for the human strongholds in gondor and move on to the rocky stairs to cirith ungol where an even darker enemy lies in wait. meanwhile the rest of the fellowship reunites in rohan having defeated the wizard saruman on two different fronts at helms deep and isengard. they are not together for long though since the hobbit pippin gets into trouble making it necessary for him and gandalf to hastily depart for minas tirith capital of gondor. once there they find the steward of gondor denethor in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of sauron. denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son faramir back into bloody battle to prove himself. he returns nearly dead sending denethor over the edge of sanity.in another realm elf arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the grey havens on her way to leave middle-earth -- and aragorn -- forever but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. back in rohan the men are preparing to ride to gondors aide. ê_owyn desperately wants to join the men in battle but her uncle king thê©oden orders her to stay and defend rohan if necessary. the hobbit merry also desires to ride with the men but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. aragorn is met there by the elf elrond who brings him the re-forged sword that was broken in the ancient battle with sauron and urges him to take a different route to gondor. heeding elronds advice aragorn along with elf legolas and dwarf gimli takes a cavernous path through the mountains where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed aragorns ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. all but frodo sam and gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the pelennor before the gates of minas tirith. the former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the one ring as they head toward the fires of mount doom to destroy it. the thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments bigger battles more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.it is visually stunning as it pops your eyes excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.jackson boldly and faithfully brought j.r.r. tolkiens world to life as hes created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.aside from thatthe movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.standing out amid an excellent cast is elijah wood stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.aside from thatit provides the viewer a great tale of heroes bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits elijah woods frodo and sean astins sam that touches us most of all.this is a masterpiece of filmmaking. yesterday i traveled 250 km to athens greece to watch the dark knight since i was in a town with no cinemas i was anxious after having watched batman begins and also curious to see for myself just how accurate the reviews that praised the film were and also just how good could heath ledgers acting really be. as a quick overall conclusion i must say that the dark knight is a masterpiece. dont get me wrong but calling a film a masterpiece doesnt make it flawless and doesnt automatically grant it a 10/10 mark. anyway in my opinion classifying a work of art as number 1263 or 134 of all time is a total waste of time. there cannot be any objective criteria in art and especially in films. there are so many genres so many different things a film can offer you and so many themes explored in the art of cinema that such a classification doesnt do any justice neither to the creators nor to the audience of a film. starting with the storyline. the dark knight can be watched without having watched batman begins. that is a very essential point. this is what makes a film whole and unique. those ready to watch a cartoon -like comic book superhero film should not even bother... this is christopher and jonathan nolans vision of a realistic 21st century metropolis controlled by organized crime actual mafia and every level of its infrastructure corrupt by it. everyone knows that you dont want to mess with such a regime because the consequences will be catastrophic and unpredictable as in a war. and people are obviously scared. therefore what is needed is someone to take this fear and through a symbol or an idea lash it out on the crime lords. this is batman. but this will inevitably lead to war. a war where anything is acceptable and the heroes morals and methods are always put to the test because as symbols their actions can be checked only by themselves. but batman is human and therefore flawed. who gives him the right to decide whats wrong or right therefore out of this war social instability grows and anarchy rises. that is what the joker represents no morals no apparent motives other than the destruction of the social network. in batman begins ras al ghoul wanted to create a new order of justice through chaos. joker goes one step further. he wants to establish chaos itself as the new order. the world is in a state of chaos anyway. crime rules and the only one willing to fix things and give people the justice they deserve is a man dressed up as a bat congratulations this is an idea worth watching on screen why stay true to the cartooned image of previous batmen when you can explore such a brilliant idea and the film is filled with several plot twists agonizing dilemmas and very meaningful dialogue. of course there are minor flaws plot-wise. sometimes the various events are a little confusing. the scarecrows cameo appearance is out of place. he should have a larger part in the film or not at all. the mutation of harvey dent into twoface near the end of the movie should have been explored more and at a slower pace. if there is one more film to complete a trilogy with twoface as the main villain i would be content. the directing by christopher nolan is fast-paced and tight. the movie stretches to 25 hours but in such a relentless pace that in the end all you want is more the only objection is that some action scenes near the end are a little too chaotic. you cant really make out whats happening. but others could object that thats the way batman works the villains cant really make out what exactly hit them in the end its all a matter of taste. ive left the acting for last because of the hype surrounding heath ledgers portrait of the joker. well the rumors are true: heath ledger is breathtaking. his joker is so believable and realistic that sometimes you think that the actor actually is a homicidal psychopath and not just acting the comparison to any other actor in this movie is completely out of place. heath ledger is in a league of his own. and that is extra credit to him considering that the rest of the cast did a fantastic job also. my personal favourites were aaron eckhart as harvey dent gary oldman as jim gordon and morgan freeman as lucius fox. michael caine should have more screen time though. least favourite was maggie gylenhaal. contrary to the general opinion i preferred katie holmes. but overall the performances were outstanding. christian bale is left for last: this is my favourite vision of batman. bale continues the work he did in batman begins. he creates a character complete in every way but in this film he somewhat lacks the emotional strength he had in batman begins. overall the dark knight is a complex crime drama of epic proportions filled with fast and banging action scenes ingenious storyline and brilliant acting by an all-star cast lead by a monumental performance by the late heath ledger. his joker is not only the best comic-book-villain-on-film but also one of the best villains in the history of the film industry. whether or not hell get an oscar is totally irrelevant. after all jack nicholson never won an oscar for his joker... who by the way should not be compared with ledgers joker because the logic behind each role is different. with christopher nolan behind the camera an actor as great as jack nicholson could have pulled off something similar or better. you can never know.yes stephen king writes drama. he also wrote stand by me the green mile and dolores claiborne. he has definitely been typed as a horror writer when he is an amazing tearjerker. this film is amazing. words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. i thought that i would not like this film as it looked like a bad sports movie. but when my science teacher told me i should see it because its a movie where you just go wow. i did and i was literally in tears by the end. not in tears of sadness but tears of joy. because the film was simply so beautiful. not very many films have made me cry. of course i cried at the endings of marley and me and toy story 3. but there are only 3 films ive ever cried at. some people say citizen kane or the godfather are the best movies ever. false. they are overrated. this film is a diamond in the rough. most people are stubborn and wont even take this gem into consideration. it truly is the best movie ever. the music the direction the cast. i wont give anything away you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty but i will say that the music in this film puts john williams to shame and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations life can still be great. it is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench.yes it is definitely one of my top ten films i have made the point in the past that if an alien came down to earth and didnt know what a film was that this would be what we should show them it is a masterpiece in storytelling and general entertainment it is split into eight short chapters each with their own strengths but none which manage to disappoint you can jump in at any point during the film and be entertained as it does not focus very heavily on story but rather portrays the perfect mix of action adventure comedy crime drama and lots lots more it has a universal appeal and had me personally on the edge of my seat watching it due to its phenomenal tension and suspense i could watch it 100 more times and would not get bored ive said it before and ill say it again: this is the perfect filmyes i loved the dark knight. it is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil and everything in between. i want to go on and discuss particular scenes that i found to be powerful but i really think you need to go into it as fresh as possible. surprisingly the trailers which seem to give too much away dont really come close to revealing what happens throughout. but what does happen is just as enticing as the brief glimpse during the preview. one complaint some may have is the length. it is around two and a half hours but frankly i didnt feel it. in fact a friend of mine who attended the screening with me looked at me after the end credits_ã_ he wanted to watch it again right then and there. i guess with any movie you should try and not build it up too much because there is always someone who wont like a certain film no matter what it is. yet in the end heath ledgers joker aaron ecklands harvey dent and a phenomenal vision realized by christopher nolan makes tdk easily one of the years best.yes absolutely my nr 1 movie quotes tension a nice story and last of all the actors samuel l jackson john travolta harvey keitel & bruce willis those four actors make the movie like its a shot from an ordinary day off a gangsters life marvelousyeah must admit. this is my fav movie of all times. if tarantinos reservoir dogs was amazingly shocking this time is maturely shocking. it is just that way tarantino drives the audience that leaves me thinking. samuel l. jackson john travolta and uma thurman just rule. the scene where the last two dance at the jack rabitt slim is one of the most simple and yet beautiful dance scenes in time. so does the restaurant scene with honey bunny and pumpkin...its a total standout its that way that samuel jackson treats the situation...really a blow-out a must see. all over the movie the audience keep thinking on what if... what if i shoot right here right now yeah what its just the way tarantino plays with the wild emotions hiding into ourselves...he just blows peoples minds with this movie tarantino has to be accepted as tha master he is both directing and writing.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump. wrote this elsewhere copying cause i dont feel like doing a new one ill start this by saying that this may not be for everyone metacritic currently has it at a 75100 which is understandable the movie can probably be best described as the campy james bond type spy movie for the modern age it takes the risks that no bond movie will probably ever take again not since the disaster that die another day was they make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that its what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall until itkind of does break the fourth wall a little to enjoy the film youre gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if youre expecting this to be a skyfall style spy movie seeing posters for this did nothing for me when i first heard about it then the trailers grabbed my attention what i wasnt expecting was just how violent it was going to be the action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman again youre gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it if youre incapable of doing so just dont bother seeing it if you can i think youll enjoy it most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly twice they applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene more applause at the end im not quite sure how colin firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before he absolutely nails it samuel l jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers micheal caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role i feel like they really underutilized his talents wasnt expecting mark hamill to be in it but was pleased with his appearance and his british accent was completely believable if i hadnt seen pictures of hamill prepping for star wars 7 i wouldve thought he was just some random british middle aged actor mark strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic the big surprise to me was taron egerton who i had to look up ill admit the lead of the film the guy who kind of looks like josh hutcherson it honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this british bruv to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly the charm and wit of james bond the transformation is believable and impressive looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that hes only24 i think? i dont think its completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace daniel craig maybe hes not the best choice but hes made my list might not grow out of his boyish face but if he does he should get a call anyway aside from the individual performances the movies plot is completely ludicrous in a fun way the violence is over stylized but the humor is quite fun after seeing all the comedies ive seen certain jokes are just predictable and kingsman has its share but some jokes are quite surprising tldr summary intentionally campy a lot of fun if you dont expect a serious spy film quite funny super violent at times i can only really compare it to 300actually no this is more like a spy version of kickass really but its not quite as gory more entertaining than most movies i saw last year if theres a sequel i will watch it also sophie cookson may just be my new celebrity crush and also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service im signed up for but when i find time im gonna pay to see it againin 13 ****ing days edit back to the kick ass comparison i think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend i took to see it it may enjoy the same cult classic status luckily forit it will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters may give it enough time to gain that appreciation in my personal opinion its better than kick asswriterdirector richard linklater is no doubt one filmmaker who has not received the spotlight he deserves in the hood of hollywood he has directed such wondrous films as before sunrise before sunset before midnight school of rock dazed & confused and much more however this mid 40s boy is about to get the attention he deserves for his marvelous work in writing & directing the comingofage flick boyhood and when i say comingofage i really mean it boyhood took 12 years to film it captures the life of the young protagonist mason jr from the time he is 5 years old all the way to he is 17 it was filmed in bits and pieces in a 12 year span linklater formulates a viable authenticity in the life of a child to teenager family life insecurity identification stability discovery etc mason jr is a child of divorce and linklater develops mason jr not so much as a victim of an unstable family life but a young survivor who still maintains his noble dignity throughout lifes experiences ellar coltranes astounding performance as mason jr from child to teen is of oscar caliber ethan hawke and patricia arquette also delivered excellent work as masons divorce parents mason sr and olivia linklaters reallife daughter lorelei linklater shows that the linklater talent is being passed on quite splendidly with her solid performance as mason jrs sister samantha this is no childs play boyhood is one of the best movies of 2014 ***** excellentwriter/director quentin tarantino demonstrates his encyclopedic grasp of filmmaking by bending chopping and deconstructing narrative while keeping a groovy beat brilliant and brutal funny and exhilarating jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet all the details are executed to perfection ironies abound in the smallest situations the experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel a little bit tiring a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers the movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careerswriter and director quentin tarantinos pulp fiction qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994 and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film this crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men a treacherous boxer a cocaine-snorting drug dealers wife and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore if tarantino had not made any other movie he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with pulp fiction he juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society whether they be murderers thieves narcotics dealers sexual perverts or small-time pistol-wielding crooks pulp fiction defies chronological time because tarantino stages everything out of order this fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull ultimately tarantino and co-scenarist roger avary received the oscar for best original screenplay while the academy of motion picture arts and sciences nominated tarantino for best director the film itself for best picture john travolta for best actor sally menke for best editing and samuel l jackson and uma thurman respectively for best supporting male and female roles over ten years later pulp fiction is still outstanding largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem tarantinos quotable dialogue his articulate underworld thugs and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity inspite of the scrambled up stories tarantino plots everything very carefully foreshadowing situations and predicaments with characters facing the consequences of their actions tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece pulp fiction opens in a restaurant with ringo/pumpkin tim roth of reservoir dogs discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend yolanda/honey bunny amanda plummer of the prophecyand their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant colorful credits follow and tarantino introduces us to jules samuel l jackson of shaft and vincent john travolta of saturday night fever as vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in amsterdam a quarter-pounder is called a royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system they arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attachê© case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south jules questions brett frank whaley of the doors about the guys questionable business practices with jules boss marsellus wallace all the dumbfounded brett can utter after he witnesses jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word what jules warns him not to say what again nevertheless brett says what five times and jules puts a bullet in his shoulder vincent and jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a cannon like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them the guy misses each time and jules and vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander marvin phil lamarr of old dogs after they kill brettwow what can we say about this film. it is one of the best of all-time that is no question. it has altered my perceptions in a lot of ways. i had not read the books so i felt that i could safely watch the film without nit-picking at all the details the movies had left out. i found some people doing that but even those people said it was still pretty true to the story. knowing that and also getting the thrill of experiencing the lord of the rings for the first time was unbelievable. i had watched the fellowship of the ring for the first time on video and i was immediatley hooked. when two towers came out i had to see it the first day out as well as return of the king. i also did some research on tolkien after that and found some reasons of why he wrote it as well. knowing that he wrote it because he wanted to and not just to make a point was astounding to me he just loved to create characters drama and just plain good storyline. noone does that anymore yet i was truly inspired. i have never been so inspired by a movie. it literally took my breath away i believe we are all living in the lord of the rings. whatever your adventure is wherever your heart is at whatever challenges you face we can all learn from lord of the rings. there is always hope.wow what can be said about interstellar that hasnt been said before? so ill just share my thoughts and feelings about this movie the nolan brothers have hit yet another homerun with this intergalactic masterpiece the story is about a single father whos trying to raise his children and provide for them and his father in law the world is sick very sick in fact cropses are dying and harvests are lost farmers have become the worlds most important job but soon humanity or at least a very small part of it realizes earth can not be saved and that they have to turn to the stars to find salvation matthew mcconaughey has come a long way since his roles as a piece of mancandy in chickflicks and he proves it yet again here he plays his role as cooper perfectly the heartache he has to go through while making an impossible choice really pulls you into the story saving humanity or seeing his children once more anne hathaway fits the role of brand well shes not sexualized as she was in the dark knight rises which gives her the chance to win you over with her acting and win you over she will michael caine is michael caine so you know what to expect there greatness jessica chastain is wonderful as murph shes so strong yet so fragile and its just heartbreaking to watch her emotional journey cassey affleck takes on the role of murphs brother and does a great job theres one more surprise appearance by a big actor which i wont spoil for you you can already tell the acting jobs are top notch in this picture and they have to be the story touches on some existential themes which are difficult to comprehend you have to understand and feel the emotions the characters are going through to grasp the purpose of the story fully visually interstellar impresses with actual physicists working on the movie you get the most accurate pictures of unearthly events the visual of black hole gargantua is actually being used in a scientific publication the other planets the team visit are equally stunning as they are interesting without going in too much detail the planets feature things we all know but they are portrayed in a way youve never seen before now let me take the time to gush over the music in this film you may think the music isnt as important as the acting or the story but its with music this good you understand it is actually a character in the movie the music is gorgeous its epic when it needs to be and emotional when the story requires it i found myself nearly in tears over the music when i didnt expect it hans zimmer proves he can create delicate and fragile pieces of music as well as epic dark and heavy soundtracks like he has done for the dark knight trilogy so in summary interstellar isnt just a space movie it isnt a science fiction movie at heart its a movie about humanity and about saving it and not just in a literal sense its about finding our own humanity its about family its about love because that is the main theme which drives the characters its the core foundation for all their actions and choices but above all this film is about hope its about believing in ourselves and the power we can muster when we fight for our loved ones interstellar is one of the most amazing movies ive ever had the privilege to see please go see this filmwow what a movie its not only the best of the lord of the rings trilogy it also is one of the best movies of the past couple of years. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is a totally spectacular movie. it has some of the most amazing battle scenes in movie history. the word spectacular isnt good enough to describe it its breathtaking epic and emotional involving. who didnt wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with aragorn towards a large number of orcs for honor and glory even though the special effects are far from the best ever peter jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. the use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable. i think lots of people were worried after the lord of the rings: the two towers after seeing the battle of helms deep. how was peter jackson ever going to top that great battle well with the lord of the rings: the return of the king he topped it alright the battle for middle earth is something youve never seen before. greatest moment was when the riders of rohan charged it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts just when you thought the battle was over those large creatures appeared really great moment. the characters are possibly at their best in this movie. no characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie even gollums still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on imdb.com. its also not really deserving all those oscars it won. like all the lord of the rings movies its great spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book. also the movie is far from flawless. once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending couldnt they just think of one ending i expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on. despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battles sequences. truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/wow what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start so as a future film maker i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you havent seen it yet go out and buy it because you wont be disappointed at all believe you me.wow this movie is so good ive seen it 200000 times now. i remember when it was #1 on imdb top 250. the only movie since imdbs conception that a newly

movie is incredible and very underrated yes its true the plot doesnt make much sense when you are watching it or even when you think back on it but who the hell cares its a brilliantly filmed stylish and original piece of work by a true master of cinema brian de palma there are several sequences in this film that blow my mind 1 the first job near the beginning2 the ultrastylish eyepopping breathtaking nailbiting brilliant computer room breakin sequence with tom cruise hanging from a cable on the ceilingwoah3 the scene in the restaurant with the fish tank notice how the angles on the characters when theyre talking get increasingly more crooked 4 and the mindboggling finale on the bullet train you wont believe your eyes dont watch this movie and expect it to be realistic because it isnt it is totally overthetop and implausible but its supposed to be and thats what makes it fun just realizeit is a movieand enjoy it as a fun amazing stylish brilliant thrill ridewow so many 110 & 1010 reviews seems theres something with this film that is incredibly divisive after reading many reviews heres what ive found many people forgot this is a fiction a grand glorious tale a moment of wonder and fun and adventure heres my rebuttal to all the naysayers deriding its science and improbable hero actions wizard of oz star wars watch the ending without music for a total roflmfao alice in wonderland narnia the lord of the rings only three of these stories involve wormholes two have a talking lion another has trees that walk around one has a cat that rips its own head off and turns invisible in bands and the believability of any of these movies is absolute zero good thing that theres overriding reasons to watch a film joy entertainment a fun adventure interstellar is a staggering glorious wonderful journey i left totally sated feeling light and wonderful its a beautiful brilliant rollicking through space and time 1110 purely for enjoymentwow just one word-brilliant. christopher nolan has done it again with this masterpiece. the movie has everything. it cannot be better. the highlights of the movie are obviously the joker. heath ledger has taken the movie to a better level. the brilliance of is acting has made joker more liked than the hero of the film. the dark knight is the best batman movie ever made and no one should miss this movie. this is the best movie of the century. harvey dent is also awesome in this one. the characters are really real. they look like real life characters rather than comic ones. the joker the batman harvey dent commissioner gordon rachel  alfred  fox all of them have done a mind blowing job. the movie has exciting background music done by hans zimmer. the entry of joker is surprising. and the climax of the movie is very intense.wow i honestly do not know what else to say except wow. usually superhero kind of movies do not really impress me but this one is incredible wow wow wow wow anyone who loves good directing good story lines incredible acting great art and absolute awesomeness will really really really love this movie. its going to be one of those movies that i will not forget for a very very long time. i was not so thrilled to watch the movie at first because i was very sad and shocked about what happened to heath ledger. but a few years later i was bored and decided to just a movie. i stumbled upon the dark knight and decided to try and watch the first half and if i didnt like ill just look for another movie to watch. well the movie was amazing that i was was hocked from the first few minutes. i was watching intently the whole time. r.i.p to the amazing heath ledger. what an incredible and an unforgettable performance you will be badly missed if you havent watched this masterpiece then i recommend you do.wow christopher nolan created an absolutely amazing batman movie. i loved everything about the movie. batman was always my favorite superhero. i watched batman begins all the time as a kid and it became a favorite of mine. then i saw the dark knight in a movie theater when i was 7 or 8 and i was totally blown away by it. the dark knight was perfectly casted. christian bale made an incredible batman heath ledger as the joker was the best acting performance of all time and i doubt anyone will top it anytime soon. there were so many great scenes like the interrogation scene the chase scene the bank heist intro joker crashing the party joker exploding the hospital and jokers magic pencil trick. batman is the best superhero ever and the joker is the best super villain ever and the dark knight is the best movie sequel ever.words cannot explain the thoughts i have on this movie unlike the new xmen i think the more you think about it the more you like it although both movies were equally good guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie i may even see it again i have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you it was very true to the characters and let me say i had doubts about vin diesels talent between groots small role in speech but now i dont think anybody else could have matched how well he performed marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with its movies however i highly doubt that and i cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by marvel roll on josh brolin and his take on thanoswonderful movie by all standards i did not find any faults worth mentioning cast: wonderful output: terrific production: excellent everything perfectly i loved all the actors and the roles that they performed ----------------------------------------------- battles: the last thing ..... frankly i did not watch the epic movie to such a degree battles give you a real sense of performance the story in general is very beautiful and not where any faults worth mentioning the course of the story as well as a very very same story excellent cutting scenes excellent graphics filming of professional. i do not know what to say more than one piece only ... thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful workwithout doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. however this is one of those cases when it simply just does. this soul finding awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of stephen kings 1982 novella entitled rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. this is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance anything can be over come. set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of america. a man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad as so many of the inmates succumb to. as simon and garfunkel had their books and poetry to protect them me so the lead character andy dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. in rita hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. he gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. even the old master lag played by morgan freeman can only watch this man from a distance. however he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as gb shaw would say was superman. eventually like a great master he exposes the lieshypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. this is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul.with well adapted characters more direction than a compass and loads more power than a puch from mike tyson this film is an absolute must-see. tarintino the director which brought us reservior dogs and true romance has created what i claim as a top 10 in cinematic history.  casablanca one flew over the cuckoos nest raging bull the godfather reservoir dogs schindlers list tgtbtu taxi driver goodfellas l.a confidential apocalypse now fight club and so on and so forth. i would recommend this or the godfather for any person that wants to get in movies. since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 with the final installment coming through everybody can recognize the greatness of not only the return of the king but of the trilogy as a whole. despite not being a fan of fantasy movies i was completely taken by the magic of the story and particularly peter jacksons incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie and raise the scales of film making. the return of the king grabs audiences and places them in with the characters one by one. it is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 oscars and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of the hobbit to see if peter jackson can outdo himself. rating: 10/10with îbatman beginsî_ by christopher nolan tried something brash . a reboot to the film path of the famous hero of dc comics who had already experienced four transfers to the big screen with the original inspired top touch of burton. the 2005 film  however constituted a more management - an attempt to prepare the hero  something that you would complete in a future sequel despite an expected attractive adventure . and because the cinema management and preparations -profile within the limits of the sail hardly enjoy direct assessment and acceptance the challenge is quickly forgotten . as the next ... the îdark knightî_ is a film haunted . the question that arises is whether this feeling is due solely to the unexpected death of ledger and expenses  presence on the big screen . there is a flood of stimuli that attack you throughout the course of the film and this is enough to convince that the film not only enjoyed by the tragic circumstances of a death . in one scenario is pervasive gloomy atmosphere and as the story progresses it becomes increasingly conscious . traditional clichê©s blockbusters canceled by anarchist way  particularly in the second half  where anything can go wrong goes and all that is dominated by death and loss . all main characters dominate the screen without nevertheless thwarted action . the bale experiencing two natures hero literally torn . the eckhart - probably the most favored role screenplay - initially posing charming hypnotized us as soon as his character changes the standards . the oldman despite strictly earthly existence of the role is never on the sidelines . the maggie gyllenhaal and loses if the impressions in the last scene of overall standing in the only decent actress . the morgan freeman and michael caine can not help but complement beautifully cast in two key roles . make no mistake  though. the true protagonist of îdark knightî_ no different from heath ledger and the joker . is itself a living horror  a freak storyline than their worst nightmares . in some scenes may remind you of a psychotic alter-ego of edward scissorhands or something of the unique otherworldly figure of hannibal lecter. thanks to him much the movie looks so dark and threatening. personally at least  it took me a few seconds to inspiration magic scene input to  forget  that the same role was impersonate the great nicholson. combining creative logic of a blockbuster with a full script and insightful directorial eye of nolan the îdark knightî_ gives the best explanation for the original intentions of îbatman beginsî_. in a film where various identified - operational - oddly  it is not surprising that the major disadvantage is also a paradox . there is so much to 145 minutes can hardly meet the viewer from only one view . despite the apparent lack of economy  however  the  dark knight  looks capable resurrect halls in lean periods . and do not be surprised if you found high in the preferences for the upcoming oscars without going necessarily refer only to level roles ledger background music or art direction . sorry for bad english :with more than 3000 reviews there isnt much to say about this masterpiece. but it deserves many more reviews. this is a film of a lifetime. seriously. it crosses all the lines of its genre in order to give all of us a showcase of every name involved. not only christian bale or health ledger are unforgettable. everything in this movie camera script performances story action direction is at the highest and beyond. its a movie made with style and groundbreaking aces on the hood. it could be shocking that this movie is so considered in all film lists across the world. but be prepared to be moved and surprised. at present day the filmmakers can still deliver masterpieces to audiences than can destabilized the ancient classics. this is a new classic. and it even deserves the #5 spot for me. my own parents guide: sex & nudity: 1/10. very poor content of this and just passionate kisses. violence & gore: 8/10. this is not a so violent or graphic movie but when it comes its really intense and sometimes upsetting the jump scene with the false batman two face looking most of joker attacks against people which includes plant an explosive inside a man stomach kill one man with the infamous magic trick scene.... profanity: 5/10. some language but not so remarkable. alcohol/drugs/smoking: 3/10. very poor content again. nothing too much relevant. frightening/intense scenes: 10/10. its not about frightening except for the jump scene but it does about intensity. the whole movie is brilliantly dark and extremely real with people and situations really hard and truly moving at times. this is the most intense batman movie. even more intense and violent than the next one: rises. total: 27/50. despite this can be a so low mark of explicit content in a so convoluted movie like this one its a really not for kids movie and one of the most intense superhero movies ever. and the most disturbing in batman trilogy.with all of the talk about heath ledger getting an oscar i feel that it is only right to state that that was not him. arkham mustve given the joker an early parole to appear here because for all accounts that was the joker i saw on screen as this was the most realistic portrayal of my favorite villain that i have ever seen. it has been a long time since i have clapped at the end of a movie but it seems i was not alone as most of the packed audience i was viewing with had to agree. this has to be considered one of the best movies of the year the scope and vistas were spectacular and this was batmans against the joker in a tour de force effort that both the writer and producer should be proud ofwith a director like david fincher you can expect a few things the man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers and hes also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011s the girl with the dragon tattoo gone girl is a bestselling novel from 2012 written by gillian flynn who also wrote the screenplay and stated that it deviates from the novel i can confidently say it has been a long time since ive gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive considering a majority of the years biggest movies appear during awards season nick dunne ben affleck and his wife amy rosamund pike seem to be the ideal couple from humble beginnings to a whirlwind engagement at face value no one could doubt how flawless a couple they seem eventually on the day of their fifth anniversary amy goes missing nick calls the police who do their duty yet after studying the apparent home invasion remain suspicious her disappearance creates a media frenzy turned witchhunt and nicks behaviour and surfacing lies surrounding the marriage are interpreted by the media and public as characteristics of a sociopath did nick kill his wife? and just where is amy? two words easily sum up gone girl for me riveting and haunting american suburbia is turned upside down and the many clues left behind for nick become more engrossing as he remains onestep ahead of the everyone nick and amy are the kind of characters that will jettison an actor into a household name ben affleck continues to do extremely solid work these past couple of years and with that said this is easily rosamund pikes finest hour and if theres any justice she is easily going to win acclaim for her performance its good to see neil patrick harris and tyler perry leave comedy behind once in a while because if this is the result then i was also wonderfully engrossed finally kim dickens missi pyle and the screen debut of carrie coon complete this casting jigsaw puzzle david fincher always gets the most out of his cast according to producer ce_n chaffin fincher took on average as many as 50 takes for each scene and everyone just feels natural what is left to say is that the music by trent reznor and atticus ross is fantastic and finchers camera work is as sublime as ever shadows and light help blur how events unfold many shots look good enough to go on a postcard and the way how your support and opinion of a character can change as the movie progresses baffles me how they pulled it off this well even though the finale may be a big turnoff for some people it ends ambiguously enough to never set the future in stone and doesnt betray such an impressive atmosphere the film has continuously grown from the beginning final verdict i really liked it and i dont how i could make that fact more clearer gillian flynn does justice to her work and the result is probably one of 2014s best thrillers and could possibly be my favourite film of the year so far its always great to see a david fincher movie be so familiar and so well

this film is a piece of art  2  the story is unique  3  very smart plot  3 stories in one  4  the characters are interesting each one of them got something that makes them so real  5  the dialogues so so real  you feel like its random talks by real people from real life not actors playing a role in a film  6  so many awesome scenes  7  one of the greatest dances ever in a film  mei & vincent  8  you can re watch it anytime and enjoy it  because the more you watch it  the more you discover things happen that you havent notice from the first time  9  this film is by quentin tarantino  10  its already rate 90why so serious christopher nolans the dark knight is a critically acclaimed movie that skyrocketed the batman franchise back into popularity among youth and adults alike. the movie has already been rated as possibly one of the greatest movies of all timewhy shawshank redemption isnt rated 9.9/10 is beyond me. what has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. a movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like facebook or youtube its all about stories. shawshank has many small instances that frank darabont included like when red leaves a small note to andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. another small instance is when andy gives red the harmonica it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. its a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable over and over again. i am convinced thats why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly its the small things that touch you. how many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...its the most powerful of goals we can have hope really sets you free.why is the dark knight so serious for many good reasons. christopher nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like batman and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. he has directed christian bale into the most serious batman character of all. he sure did direct the late heath ledger into performing as the best joker of them all and ledger did not work to upstage bale or the other actors in any way. ledger should definitely win a posthumous oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds. if christopher nolan was old enough he should have done batman movies instead of tim burton or joel schumacher put together. tim burtons mood was dark as well but as im looking at it now michael keaton was a more sloppy batman kim basinger was a mousy vicky vale and jack nicholson overdid his joker performance. in batman returns also directed by burton and starring keaton the commercialism continues adding michelle pfeiffer as a more idiotic catwoman than the catwomen on the 1960s tv series and danny devito who still was a wounded penguin but not enough that we feel sorry for him. then in the mid 1990s keaton didnt want to play batman anymore feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. looking for more actors often typecast as villains director schumacher got tommy lee jones to parody his villain persona as harvey two-face dent. also there was still that rubberface persona in jim carrey as the riddler as well. 1997s batman and robin was a total washout. so nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors mature less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. in 2005 batman begins was just the beginning but the dark knight is the real story. it would be sin that christopher nolan does not get nominated for an oscar just as well as heath ledger for best director. christian bale is and many people would agree with me the best batman of them all. with his rich performance we do know him better than adam west michael keaton val kilmer and george clooney put together. we know bruce waynes haunted past and demons and why he becomes his alter ego batman to fight crime in gotham city. unlike cesar romero and jack nicholson heath ledger is a much more complicated joker. he doesnt torture people just for pure torture. he doesnt laugh maliciously between every single sentence. he grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit batman as a fraud for gotham city even bringing in batman clones with the typical caped crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell bruce wayne will the real batman stand up all the other actors give excellent detailed performances. maggie gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than katie holmes mrs. tom cruise as bruce waynes love interest assistant d.a. rachel dawes but is smitten with d.a. harvey dent aaron eckhart in the end. gary oldman in one of his few good-guy roles does a fine turn as the mustachioed commissioner gordon more serious than the one weve seen on tv. veteran thespians michael caine and morgan freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler alfred and the gadget inventor lucius fox. these two men get better with age each time they make movies. and aaron eckhart plays harvey two-face dent not as a torturous villain like tommy lee jones did before but as a victim wounded by the jokers torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets. the summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. ive seen mamma mia as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing notably by pierce brosnan. ive seen wall-e which i thought was pixars blander efforts. remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. but the dark knight is the best movie of the summer. when it comes to comic book stories as i said before directors burton and schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. nolan never does.  there is nothing to say. it is just exceptionally plain good. a must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart. why do i want to write the 234th comment on the shawshank redemption i am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. but like so many other people who wrote comments i was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. the only other movie i have ever seen that effects me as strongly is to kill a mockingbird. both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them. i didnt intend to see this movie at all: i do not like prison movies and i dont normally watch them. i work at a branch library and one day as i was checking the shawshank redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me whenever i feel down or depressed i check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better. at the time i thought that was very strange. one day there was nothing on tv except things i absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that i had seen too many times already. i remembered what she said so i watched it. i have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing. no action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.who would have thought colin firth could play such a suave james bond type? he displays enough cockiness looks quite dapper in his custom made suite and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie jackson also has the time of his life with his speech impediment villain in addition to that we are treated to the training phase of the future spies and unlike birdman where theres nothing funny this parody skewers the genre giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie we have the gadgets the action scenes the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few we meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world who wouldnt love the poisonous tip oxfords the cool pens key chains and doesnt that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter? in order to give the film more panache we have to include michael caine who has already graced a few batman films with his class and mark strong adds a touch of cerebral ability as he must prove his resources are after all important to succeed in this era what is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world of course the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway so it wouldnt take much to trigger that type of behavior this is a movie that is a bit over two hours but we dont want it to end because it is so much fun there are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like theyre trying to be original as they criticize satirize or make a halfhearted and pretentious parody of other genres kingsman is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it i cant remember how many times i look at my time during birdman but i had forgotten i had a watch or a cell phone while i laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there we might getting too much of the marvel universe with a break needed soon it is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done a good work of art doesnt try that hard to call attention to itself instead its all there and it flows naturally on its way to its welldeserved recognition without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is when it really isntwhilst some may argue it is over-long the return of the king is simply too powerful with too many wonderful elements and is ultimately too great an achievement to not be in my list of favourite films of all time peter jacksons adaption of this story whilst having the occasional stumble along the way was ultimately stunning. this film ties up the themes of the previous two instalments of which there are many in an emotional tour de force on a rather grand scale. when you have performances from a top-notch cast in a film about ideas as fundamentally moving as this you are hardly going to go wrong and at the centre of it all is the friendship between frodo and sam so brilliantly played by elijah wood and sean austin. friendship loyalty sacrifice love and the struggles we all face can be found committed to film in the intense few hours of the return of the king. the reason lord of the rings worked so well is that it did not become a stage for special effects which are wonderful as shown in scenes of battling with a giant spiderwhile batman begins was all about batman the dark knight is all about the joker... the perfect villain as they sayperhaps there hasnt been any character so evil or any actor so perfectly portraying the evil. heath ledger has outdone all his previous performances with just this one role of his hope he were with us to give us more such enthralling performances. r.i.p. the movie is going to be remembered for ages to come but not because in the end the good wins over the evil but specifically for the evil. ledger according to me has done the best performance in a negative role in the decade. the director christopher nolan has lived up to his reputation that he created with the following kept up with memento the prestige insomnia and batman begins and looks like the young director to watch out for along with zack snyder and robert rodriguez.am anxiously waiting for his inception coming this year.whether real or fiction if a story presents to us an example of loves transformational power it is a story worthy of our attention the reason so many of us do not waste our time learning how to love those who are difficult to love is that such a love requires a great amount of courage on our part first we must be willing to face and embrace every dark aspect of ourselves no matter how large we imagine our imperfections to be no matter how great our sense of shame over our past mistakes may be secondly to love one who is at first difficult to love also requires that we soften ourselves enough to be changed if we go the distance in learning how to love in this way the process will always transform us for the better unfortunately we do not have a lot of examples in our cultures movies books or stories of what such a transformational act of love looks like fortunately disneys film maleficent gives us such an example to all who participated in the production of this film i say well done beautiful story beautiful imagery beautifully acted and beautifully produced i felt my heart was glowing as i left the movie theaterwhere to begin with this movie this is truly my favourite movie and one of the best movies of the last decade. that is no understatement. from the start you are drawn in into a movie which depicts the demise of gotham city and the emergence of a truly great actor in ledgers depiction of the joker. why is the movie so perfect its quite simplewhere do i start when i first heard of the shawshank redemption i immediately wanted to watch it mostly of its title so as i always do i looked it up on imdb and looked at the rating. it was the highest ranked movie on imdb and of course i would give it a go. the beginning was very interesting with andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. him being found guilty serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in america shawshank. i thought it would be another overrated boring movie like the godfather but no it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. the dramatic scenes it gives you a glance of how it is in prison the emotional scenes. it is all a masterpiece there is a reason to why it is the best movie i have ever watched and probably will ever watch. the amazing acting plot and moderate length. the last scene with red walking up the beach towards andy and the credits slowly rolling in it makes you beg for it to never end. when it comes to movies i can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie which shawshank is. it definitely deserves the spot as #1 i cannot understand how it didnt win an oscar. i really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend but get a load of potato chips and soda since you will finish it all up very fast.where do i start those who have already seen this movie dont need a review and those who havent will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. so ill just say how this movie personally affected me as a fan of the books and of movies in general. i absolutely loved the original film fellowship of the ring and did enjoy the two towers though not as much. i loved the emotion of the original subtle scenes like frodos long decision-making boatside scene at the end and found that the two towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters feelings into the background. but this makes sense as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. return of the king however is just simply fantastic. i try to avoid statements like gets everything right and i enjoyed every minute of it but in this case its true. i was so moved at the presentation of this film that i couldnt help getting misty at the end despite knowing exactly what would happen based on the books of course. i credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music annie lennoxs moving into the west is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the films themes. and also i couldnt help being moved knowing that it was now all over and there will probably never be another lord of the rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime and rightfully so. i just felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends. the movie although beginning with an important flashback begins immediately where the second film concluded and every character has a conclusion. the main part of this movie that i loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchangedwhere do i even begin with the lord of the rings trilogy it is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. peter jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. before lord of the rings he made the frighteners bad taste meet the feebles and heavenly creatures. heavenly creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema and then after the frighteners came out in 1996 the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring was released in 2001 and became a critical commercial and prestigious success. the two towers had the same success in 2002 and finally the return of the king came and was the greatest of the lord of the rings trilogy and the first ever fantasy movie to win the academy award for best picture and went on to win the bafta for best film and the golden globe for best picture - drama. the return of the king won all these awards for the right reasons. it was epic gorgeous a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish and everything works. lord of the rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. j.r.r. tolkien would be extremely proud even if his son christopher isnt proud of the movies. the lord of the rings: the return of the king will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. an achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.whenever this movie comes on i have to watch it. this movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it im not going say much to spoil it for you. this movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. the time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as i saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. the end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a whats next like no other. i have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time i see the shawshank redemption i wonder what occurred after the beach.whenever i talk about this movie with my friends i do not even refer to it by title but rather as the movie. when i say the movie my friends know exactly what im talking about. in fact the main reason that me and my friends dont refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain i still remember the first time i saw the shawshank redemption. some friends of mine and i went to see it at one of those budget theaters over the summer of 1995. none of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good. so not having any real expectations we saw it. when the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. i turned my head towards my friend bob and said that was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my entire life theres really no other way i can put it in words. every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... hope. this movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny at the right times jaw-dropping and heart-warming all at the same time. i get chills every time i watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending which takes place over the last 30 minutes or soin movie history how it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. i should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that i know i will never see a better movie no matter how many i may see. ive seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films. however every time i walk out of the theater i turn to my friend or family member that i saw it with and i say that was a great movie but it wasnt nearly as good as you know what there have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that i might one day call my favorite of all time but theyve all fallen far short of the shawshank redemption. so if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately. youre guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. and if it isnt in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. if you have seen this movie go see it again. if you havent bought your own copy yet buy one. in fact buy two and put one in a fire-proof safe just in case of an emergency. :o so you want a 1-10 rating i give it a 13  casablanca one flew over the cuckoos nest raging bull the godfather reservoir dogs schindlers list tgtbtu taxi driver goodfellas l.a confidential apocalypse now fight club and so on and so forth. i would recommend this or the godfather for any person that wants to get in movies. since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 whenever i see a prison or even think about it the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. maybe its because i have watched this masterpiece so many times that its actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. i just cannot explain how well this film is made. the direction and screenplay by frank darabont and the fact that it is based upon rita hayworth and shawshank redemption by stephen king makes it highly likable. moving on to the performances by tim robbins as andy dufresne and morgan freeman as ellis boyd red redding they shine just like a diamond stupendous performances by them. i still cant believe that it never got any major accolade and didnt even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which cant be missed.when you think of great films you think of pulp fiction inception se7en the godfather and the dark knight. this is because of its brilliant acting captivating storyline interesting characters and excellent dialogue. the dark knight has all of these things. as everyone knows heath ledgers performance was spectacular and aaron eckhart as harvey dent. it is directed and co-written by christopher nolan inception memento and co-written by david s. goyer man of steel blade. it has just the right mix of action character development emotion and jokes. all in all it is a classic movie and will live on through out the ages as the best superhero film of all time.when you look at imdbs top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like star wars the godfather the lord of the rings and others. not saying that these movies are bad they are actually quite brilliant they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. star wars started the sci-fi age the godfather made people interested in the secret society of the mafia and lord of the rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. but what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. in 1994 frank darabont decided to have a go on one of stephen kings novels not knowing what would happen. they made a film that is honest and that contains on the contrary to star wars etc. a vital lesson a meaning and a message to all who watch it. this movie is redefining cinema. no explosions. no heart-stopping excitement. no its pure poetry music and sublime acting. the overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker andy dufresne played by tim robbins who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of shawshank prison. his life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like red wonderfully acted out by morgan freeman and brooks hatlen james whitmore brings tears to your eyes. warden norton played immensely evil by bob gunton and captain hadley clancy brown dont make andys life comfortable in the prison but with andys unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude. this film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the shawshank prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where andy locks himself up in the wardens office and plays mozart to all the inmates. morgan freemans raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie i ever saw. at the release of the film people criticised the film harshly and wasnt a big hit certainly not at the box-office. but when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. and until this day for over 4-5 years now i believe it stands on the second place in the top 250 one place away from the godfather. this is a film you have to see once in your lifewhen we learned about the new batman series i thought it would be a total failure. batman begins really proved me wrong and i was set up to be pleased if each of them was as good as batman begins. lets just say this movie blew away the first one and 99.9% of every other movie ever made. bale played batman perfectly the best yet. what really made this movie as good as it is was heath ledgers performance as the joker. it was one of the greatest performances ever he simply nailed it. michael caine was the usual michael caine he was great. another person that made the movie as good as it was is aaron eckhart he played harvey dent just like i imagined harvey dent. then when he became two face and his personality and whole character changed he nailed it too. of course gyllenhaal and freeman were great as well and the rest of the cast. if you havent seen this then do yourself a huge favor and see it.when the name christopher nolan comes to mind we think of memento the prestige inception and the dark knight trilogy as films that changed challenged and kept audiences in awe of what each of those films bring but his latest offering is indeed not only up there with the best scifi themed films such as inception gravity and 2001 a space odyssey as it plays an inspiration for interstellar along with other acclaimed science fiction classics but one of the best and original pieces of film made this year ill try not to give too much away but the story is centered on a not too distant future where the earth has become unsustainable for the human population dust storms scour the land and mankind itself has reverted to crop farming for food but with little luck to boot cooper matthew mcconaughey is widowed and once was a nasa test pilot and engineer but resides now as a crop farmer alongside his teenage son tom younger daughter murphy or murph as her nickname and fatherinlaw donald murph believes that ghosts are trying to communicate her and they have given her coordinates of a possible location to discover but it leads to secret nasa group lead by professor brand michael cane who theorizes that a possible wormhole discovered orbiting saturn could lead to possible new worlds for human colonisation and asks for coopers help in leading the expedition along with his daughter amelia anne hathaway and 2 other nasa astronauts the events that follow take off will lead to an adventure like no other thats visually spectacular emotional and engaging as said nolan has topped this works with this marvelous gem being based by theoretical physicist kip thornes work nolan gives us the scenario of human life in another universe and taking 4 years to write the most realistic script alongside his brother jonathan the final result was indeed different to what i and others were expecting the direction as always is spot on as already seen in his last films he takes story seriously pace is steady but never broken and characters are never wasted in his vision the amount of time that was taken to be convinced on screen was a long journey for nolan and his crew through financing development writing etc but the end result was indeed captivating and a step up in terms of science fiction in film the casting and performances are all fantastic these include oscar winners matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway michael caine and jessica chastain and a surprising appearance of another one but i wont be revealing thisthe supporting talents of wes bentley topher grace john lithgow casey affleck and the voices of bill irwin and josh stewart are all  mcconaughey in particular has amped up his acting roles since his role in the lincoln lawyer and only this year won best actor for dallas buyers club he gives not only a realistic depiction of man losing not only his reason for existence but yet redeem it all for the sake of mankind but he conveys emotion hope and yet convincing enough to be the films hero hathaway similarly does this as well with excellence and has driven herself to be involved in captivating films since les miserables expanding her acting range the topping performance of all in my opinion  was jessica chastain since seeing zero dark thirty she can be incredible in drama driven roles and breathing life into her characters so im betting she will get oscar attention alongside mcconaughey and hathaway music here is incredibly captivating and who else to deliver this is award winning and highly acclaimed composer hans zimmer a favorite of mine to listen to to describe intersellars zimmer says that the textures the music and the sounds and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other peoples movies a bit so its time to reinvent the endless string ostinatos need to go by the wayside the big drums are probably in the bin and like 2001 the music is beautiful and plays a role in the storys emotion visual effects here are becoming more cgi than practical but nolan highly prefers the practical magic and minor cgi to bring the realistic effect the use of miniature effects built and designed sets and production are all in for oscar worthy attention and this was possible because of visual effects team double negative overall interstellar is a captivating engaging and emotional film release of the year and only a year after gravity had changed the mold on science fiction but interstellar adds more with its concept cast music and atmosphere that creates a beautiful journey to the unknown that will indeed earn oscars wins in the next awards seasonwhen the dark knight was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadnt seen the previous batman begins simply because it was heath ledgers last completed role - and what a role it was. when you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. however when the joker visits the mob and performs the pencil trick heath becomes the joker. its a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget its an actor but heath did this astonishingly well. its hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. christian bale adds an almost comical edge to bruce wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about harvey dent. bale also performs batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. aaron eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. his noble character of harvey dent is great but its when he becomes two-face that you really see eckharts skill. its a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he like heath ledger is able to totally immerse himself in the character. the familiar characters played by gary oldman and morgan freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and maggie gyllenhaals replacement of katie holmes as rachel dawes is also not controversial and maggie acts very well. the script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. christopher nolan has done an excellent job with this film. perhaps not his best ever script but its definitely his best film so far it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat.when someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at the absurdity as a writer i conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything however i must bow to this clich_ words cannot express what i think of richard linklaters boyhood given that its been a little over 12 hours since i saw the film and im still speechless i ask you to bear with me in this review i will monologue to state that boyhood is the best film of a year thats not but _ of the way through is a stretch but i find myself limber in this instance boyhood is the best film of the year now time to stretch some more boyhood is the best film of the decade still limber no stretching needed this movie is that incredible it all began with an innovative idea from the already innovative richard linklater what if we see a family grow and age through the eyes of a child? and what if we shot it in realtime? from there a spark was ignited and eventually came to a glorious flame we do see a family age for 12 years this idea is already a selling point for the film but then throw in mr linklaters usual touch of heart and authenticity and youll have something undeniably special youll have an intimate epic a film that is so large in a technical scale and equally large in emotional sale is something hardly seen especially in the past 12 years so when boyhood premiered at the sundance film festival there was a lot hype and this excitement hasnt expired after several months instead it has grown it has traveled through america crafting an astute reputation for the film to follow so for filmgoers like myself who live in small unartistic towns find ourselves overwhelmed with praise for a film we must wait for and we did i personally waited a full monthandahalf for this film to hit el paso but 6 weeks is nothing compared to 12 years so i shall cease my complaining instead i shall say this boyhoods reputation precedes itself as the film opens were are introduced to mason the central character the boy in boyhood he is six years old and the year is 2002 this is when we begin our 12 year journey with him at the end of the school day mason is picked up by his mother olivia an electric patricia arquette early on in the film we get a sense of the living conditions of olivia but instead of shifting the narrative towards her we stick with mason and remain oblivious to the full condition of olivias life in many instances there is nothing heard or seen that mason isnt hearing or seeing if his parents are fighting in the next room we dont see it because mason doesnt see it after a few minutes mason spends time with his father ethan hawke at his finest mason sr is just what youd expect hes your typical absentee dad one who only shows up with gifts and fun but never seems to be serious about raising a family however since we see things as mason does this dad is awesome and greatly missed at this point the plot becomes clear this is a film about a broken family to scrutinize the plot would be to write an 1115 page review there is so much going on within each year of the film that the 12 year story is impossible to break down into a simple synopsis after the first 1215 minutes of the movie the film cuts to a new year 2003 and we find the characters have moved on from the last this process is continued throughout the entire film till we reach adulthood in 2013 and with this formula a masterpiece is crafted there is something so psychologically groundbreaking about this film never before has a film been so relatable so memorable and so poignant as each year appears on the screen we the audience subconsciously immerse ourselves into the same time period we recall what we thought and did in that year and find ourselves nostalgic this feeling is especially effective for members of masons generation like myself we recall the same thought patters and experiences mason goes through as we went through them with this intimacy we find ourselves reliving our childhood this beautiful feeling is something no other film has caused this is why boyhood is so groundbreaking because it is able to captivate its audience and allow us to have a relationship with it what mr linklater has done is not only craft a work of art but allow the audience to view the crafting of the work of art brick by brick line by line side by side for anybody involved in this film whether it be the filmmakers or the audience members there is an intimate oneonone feeling that transcends both time and reality and for that we are indebted to the filmmakers being masons age myself i find boyhood to be a very special film that is incredibly close to my heart as i sat in the theater watching mason head off to college i suddenly realized that that was me i too had just transitioned into adulthood and started a new chapter in my life epic in both a technical and an emotional scope boyhood defines a generation by allowing the audience to go on their own intimate journey with the characters though the film is a rough 3 hours long you feel as if it lasts the whole 12 years simply because you are reliving the period yourself boyhood is the type of movie you dont want to end because there is something so deep in the connection it made with you this i can say with no reservation boyhood is one of the most unique personal and authentic films i have ever encounteredwhen someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at

nothing more than a made-for-tv movie. however as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. yet how can a film that contains rape beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end frank darabont manages to do this so well. the green mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending but not like this does. i just love the way it follows the subplot of brooks right up until he kills himself. how touching that was to see an old man let out of prison but without routine. he belonged in prison not in the outside world. you forget at times that you are watching a movie. it sucks you in and moves you. if you havent seen shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. but dont worry - youre not beyond redemption watch itwhen it comes to quentin tarantino op delivers and this movie is by far one of the best four in one stories or tales of violence and redemption out there true that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching crime drama thriller and a little mystery in a tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies the point is that im not trying to praise the director in any way i just think that its a must to express warm approval or admiration of him genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with gg tarantino when i went to theater expecting something similar to batman begins an average good all around action movie. what i got from the dark knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. heath ledger is a master at his role. he is the best villain in any movie i have ever seen. it is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. christain bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. the plot was great and i have to say that heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.when i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about british spies but i was so wrong kingsmen is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to save the world although a very common plot this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a clich plot the longer i was watching the movie i kept on realizing how much i loved the movie it was filled with unique action an unforeseen plot and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much along with all of these features the movie was filled with a class a cast it was a very well neededwellrounded moviewhen i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was

my absolute favourites of all time. at the end it made me cry and thought about life. every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. fantastic film and worth watchingits really realistic film and another one of stephen kings great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you havent seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliant be prepared to be moved its such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. a truly lovely magical film my favourite of all time fantasticwhen i watched the nolans batman begins i was amazed by the film. i wasnt a kids movie it was haunting adventure of the dark defender and how he was formed. the intensity and the plot of the film were out of this world. batman begins was my favorite movie but then dark knight came along. the plot and the acting were superb and there were surprises till the end of the movie. the way nolan portrayed the joker was breathtaking. his laugh his attire and his acting was amazing. the actor who played joker heath ledger did an amazing job and will be remembered for this amazing role. may his soul rest in peace. nolan was also able to put the origins of two-face in the movie. harvey dent and later two face was very powerful. all he wanted was justice and to bring down every single criminal in gotham but one criminal joker changed him and made him into the villain of batman. joker indirectly killed the love of his life rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal and made him go out for revenge and made him a killer. the two lives of bruce wayne were shown beautifully. his rich playboy life and his life as batman. dark knight was an amazing film and is a must watch.when i watched shawshank redemption at firsti had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me i say that i learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free. and  dont never forgethope is good something and good somethings never die  this sentence which passes in the film i always believe it every part of mine. because a person lives with his or her hopes and passions so if it is seized from peoplethat people lose their aims in the life. and what the best properties of this film it shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...in addition to my review about shawshank redemption whenever i watch this film i learn that it puts in new things my life. it is so important for every watcher shawshank redemption should be watched and i advise it to you :when i walked out of the movie i was asked what i liked about it. everything i answered. everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intensewhen i saw this movie first time i just said how good can be because whenever i watch a series first film that i know if the first film would be great i know that the second one would be terrible but this series its just been increasingly much better than the first one. christian bale returns as bruce wayne the billionaire playboy who moonlights as batman. having eased more comfortably into a lifestyle of excess wayne lurks on the fringes of his familys corporation as ceo lucius fox morgan freeman runs the boardroom. but when an ambitious district attorney named harvey dent aaron eckhart comes forward to challenge gotham citys villainy through proper legal channels the man also known as batman sees an opportunity to replace his vigilante persona with a figure of virtue who will truly inspire the best in the citizenry.when i saw that the shawshank redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time i thought yea i could understand that. i dont necessarily agree that its absolutely the best but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top. it is the story of andy dufresne played by tim robbins and his time at shawshank prison. it is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. its funny because i dont really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. the performances are very good but nothing really noteworthy. the characters all serve the story beautifully but none of them really stand out from the others. frank darabont is great the shots are exactly what they should be. almost the entire film is shot at the prison adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. and yet we are captivated from the outset. morgan freeman could read a sears catalogue and id pay to hear it his narration breathes life into every scene that its spoken over. the real beauty of this film is its story mostly about andy and red robbins and freeman but its the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. stephen kings novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that king is not just a master of horror but a true literary genius. sure he doesnt use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters but does anyone tell as good a story king always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you cant help but get swept away. the shawshank redemption is no different. if there is a film by which other films should be judged this is as good as it can get. powerful engaging visceral despairing a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. its one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive. an amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. a masterpiece 10/10.when i saw pulp fiction the first time i knew instantly that i have to see it over and over again the cast directing story and everything matched completely in a way that i love them to match tarantino made an outstanding job in this film and i was very very disappointed when the movie did not receive oscar for best film or best direction this loss made me realize for sure that the best ones are not the ones to get the so called highest recognition but anyhow pulp fiction is and probably always will be the movie that i want to see over and over again and also the one that i want to remember for the rest of my life >when i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not. then i started watching it. from the very 1st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la jetê©e. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic. when i first watched pulp fiction i was completely controlled by its energy tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like pepe-la-peu was lead by the scent of perfume i have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie the big picture the basic stories the characters the situations that bring them together is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient yet tarantino threw in details that you wouldnt notice were placed on purpose for example listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing notice that the reason mia odd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon tarantino set that scene up subtley in lances bedroom almost an hour before the od many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made in pulp fiction tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the detailswhen i first saw this movie on video i was in 5th grade i expected to see a action film because bruce willis is in it but after the movie was over i was confused and totally lost by this movie the second time i saw it i was a junior at high school and i was totally fascinated by this movie as shown in reservoir dogs tarantinos answer first question later scenes are unique and amusing to watch also the dialogues are hilarious such as conversation about foot massages and actions are bit too violent but also great i also enjoyed john travolta and uma thurmans twist scens a lot the actings are superb john travolta samuel l jackson and uma thurman gave their best performances in their careers bruce willis was still pretencious but he was okwhen i first saw this movie i was pretty confused and i had to see it a couple more times before i understood it all many critics hated mission impossible because of this i liked that it was very complicated it added to the mystery i think the part in the cia terminal room is classic very exciting this is one of brian de palmas best he throws lots of surprises at you tom cruise and ving rhames are always good together and i liked emilio estevezs part *** 12 starswhen i first saw the shawshank redemption i was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. i had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. i was tired and just wanted a little amusement. this was at a time after shawshank had been released but got little attention. i had heard some oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. i half reluctantly chose to watch it. that night i was not prepared to be blown away. i didnt see a movie i was transported by a story. i was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. i wasnt just entertained i was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. if this film remains on imdbs number one spot for a long time to come its well deserves it. to me personally the shawshank redemption is a testament as to why the 90s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. there are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching t s r: one if you havent seen it dont let any one who has seen it tell you anything about its plot dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film  the two towers doesnt match the opening movie or the climax and the best film of the decade. the return of the king is mind blowing. most seeing the movie know the plot as they have read tolkeins mighty opus. but if you have missed the news christopher lees character doesnt appear. no saruman. make sense of it and sarumans death at the hands or wraps of the worm in the book. battle of pelennor fields is a masterwork. far better than the battle scenes in russel crowes robin hood which i saw this week. scott uses flesh and blood and a mass of special effects beats him off the screen created in this monster of a movie. the bearers of the ring make the miserable ascent to their final destination to dispose of it. sauron being stuck as a giant burning eye the whole time sort of limits what he can do. peter jackson solves that with a dreamlike moment of frodos final struggle. peter jackson is clearly a genius in his ability to allow actors to act and giving them space to do so. lord of the rings would have been so much lesser had he mashed the actors in special effects and monsters like george lucas does. the biggest applause is for new zealands landscape. it is the land of lord of the rings. when i first saw pulp fiction i thought it was a kinda cool movie  violent but in a cool way shocking but in a cool way i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more its a rich intertextual film going experience its a gangstar movie for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy its a renegade boxer story its easy rider deliverance and shaft its a film noir its a melodrama its romance and action its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one when i first rented pulp fiction out of the local filmtown video store i didnt know what to think i just thought that three hours of talking who cares but when i saw the movie second timei was completely blown away bruce willis as bad as he wants to be gives everything he got while playing the role of butch he is frustrated angry scared and out of is mind at the same time well who wouldnt be if he had a mob like ving rhames tryin to catch him john travolta and samuel jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen travolta a gentleman hoodlum tries to talk sense to jackson who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment uma thurman plays her role like its in her blood she plays mia wallace a drug addict and mobs wife she kinda reminds me of courtney love it is amazing how quentin tarantino can make a conversation about european fast food restaurants sound interesting tarantino is genius i tell you genius a three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring but this is anything but that damn i shouldnt have written this now i want to watch it againwhen guardians of the galaxy was announced many people didnt know who they wereme tooafter this thoi think everyone will know who they arethe story follows peter quill and how he mets the other guardians grootrocketgamoraand draxand their first mission togetherthe story was very good and fits great with the other marvel movies and what is comingthe humor plays very great even when theres dramathe acting was also great by everyoneeveryone fit there rolesthe villain ronan was okaynot as great as loki but he wasnt the worstevery guardian was so interestingyou feel like if they had there own solo movie it would be very interestingof course the character that stand out the most was rocketbradley cooper every joke by him was always on point and very funnyanother plus was the soundtrackevery song was just so goodit fit the story i think everyone can enjoy this movieit says its pg13 but do be careful if you bring your children because there is a lot of bad languagethere is a postcredit scence so stay for thatwhen batman begins was released in the year 2009 i watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how christopher nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the joker in to his dark and serious version of batman.. so when i went to watch this movie i was ready to see the heath ledgers joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. but the joker i saw was rather just the opposite. he did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it.. its been a while since i have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie heath ledgers joker completely stole the show. everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. the movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. christopher nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put them in a dark and serious movie and make it work.. other actors also played their part well christian bale was good as batman/bruce wayne aaron eckhart was brilliant as harvey dent gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal michael caine and morgan freeman played their roles beautifully. this movie is one of my favourite movies of all time for those of you who havent watched it yet i recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..when a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a j.r.r. tolkiens lord of the rings its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. such is the case of the return of the king an absolutely colossal conclusion to peter jacksons epic vision. considering a majority of return of the king is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. if you loved the previous films you cant not love this one more. its not necessarily that the film is better. rather its so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end it stands out as an incredible experience hence its winning of the oscar for best picture. after the battle of helms deep and the defeat of isengard the armies of mordor move on gondor and the city of minas tirith. with king theoden bernard hill of rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of gondor gandalf ian mckellen and pippin billy boyd ride there to convince the steward of gondor denethor john noble the mourning father of boromir to extend his hand to rohan and in effect to aragorn viggo mortensen heir to the throne and rightful king of gondor a title the ranger struggles with. the war of the ring is something to behold even though its interrupted by frodo elijah wood and sams sean astin quest to cast the ring back into the fires of mt. doom. rather than having the forces of sauron and the armies of gondor and rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching minas tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph. on the other end we know that gollum andy serkis has plans to betray frodo and sam in order to repossess his one and only precious. the debate between the two hobbits on whether gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of gollums intentions and by this point with the ring reaching mordor it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on frodo. the story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the war of the ring and in frodo and sams quest to destroy the ring and its easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it cant possibly end in a horrible way. thats testament to the power of the storytelling going on here. how return of the king really one ups the two towers is that it doesnt feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. the momentum of the impending battle and frodo and sam inching closer and closer to mt. doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. no scene feels obligatory or like its stalling and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as pippin singing to denethor as faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger. from an action and visual spectacle standpoint return of the king completely outdoes the previous chapters. a battle sequence in which legolas orlando bloom takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. even with all the doom and gloom theres still plenty of humor in this one as well. the resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of two towers in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. everything that eowyn miranda otto does in two towers feel for naught by the end of that film but she gets her shining moment in return of the king that brings her character full circle. return of the king works well on its own but it also proves that the lord of the rings was meant to be watched together as a trilogy as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entitywhats fantastic about tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout he does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things which really helps the characters and doesnt hinder performance in any way hes absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue and it really adds to it pulp fiction feels vibrant pulp fiction feels alive and far from interminable it knows exactly what direction it going in it feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure that doesnt feel convoluted at all the story structure to me actually aids the ending and the film as a whole incredibly clever stuff from tarantino over time tarantino films have become more and more bloated but this and reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films to be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat performance wise i think everyone here is on top form its an interesting cast and a brave cast but it absolutely fits i enjoyed willis more than usual as he seems more free and relaxed travolta is handled very well which is something that i would have thought is very hard to do his characters need to be tongue in cheek and thats certainly the case here for me this is a film that can only really be done once doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling i think few could pull this off in fact i doubt even tarantino could pull it off again for bravery creative spark unique tone awesome writing and pure entertainment value i cant not give this a ten ten out of tenwhat you get when you mix a james bond movie like 007 and matthew vaughns 2010 hit kickass? you get kingsman the secret service a wildly funny and pleasing action comedy starring colin firth and samuel l jackson this film is packed with everything a great action comedy needs amazing casting gut busting humor and a fantastic script kingsman is easily one of the best funniest comedies i have seen in recent years and contains some of the most clever oneliners especially from samuel l jackson it had my friends and i laughing almost constantly throughout the duration of the film taron egerton plays eggsy a young man in his late teens or early twenties who is called by harry galahad colin firth to join a top secret organization known as kingsman a corporation of spies there he must go through a grueling training to take down an evil villain richmond valentine who is bent taking over the world by using mind control chips on everyone around the world sound familiar? the funniest part about this how the chips causes people to engage into fist fights and kill each other which is shown in various scenes this movie is filled with insanely hilarious scenes such as colin firth beating the crap out of thugs with an umbrella and eggsy blowing up everyones heads into cartoonish explosions as well as the comedic chemistry from colin firth samuel l jackson and taron egerton if you are a big fan of kickass and kickass 2 this is a movie not worth missingwhat to say this trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. cant tell you how much i enjoy watching these movies. totally a new world visually very impressive acting at very high level to action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least only 11 hours . cant have enough of these movies. its been 11 years since i watched for the first time and i still feel hungry for them. i think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than lotr and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on imdb list because these movies are timeless.what to say about the shawshank redemption i shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. this movie is freakin immaculate. darabont and co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. the movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope perseverance and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. all in all the shawshank redemption remains one of the most spectacular films i have ever seen - a master piece of art. perfect.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. i wish tarantinos follow-up to pulp fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. in my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. outside of short cuts this is the best film ive ever seen. 10 stars. what pulp fiction does is not give you the normal rinky-dink point-a to point-b generic movie the film isnt about plot progression what tarantino does in essence is create an entire world this is a vast interwoven interacting multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid solid characters what this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world into another life and accept this morally ambiguous modern-day epic truly there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer and lastly on a personal level while i do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history it is personally my favorite film and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry so obviously it must have something going for itwhat is there to say about this movie except it is a triumph in film making. first of all anything narrated by morgan freeman you know is going to be a great movie. a story of a life behind bars with no end this ordinary man turns shawshank prison up side down. i think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. there is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects just men talking to each other. tim robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. the shawshank redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see only if just to brighten your day. but i think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.what in the gods name was that my lord what a movie excellent brilliant nope this movie is more than that the characters the plot all was part of the plan what can i say about this kind of movie bale eckhart ledger ripcaine freeman everybody every scene everything in this film is just .... i cant say a word which mean over the top and more thanks mr chris nolan this what all the dark knight fans taking about this is the world of batman realistic apocalyptic im from colombia so que h. de p. pelicula tan buena. please wb do it again mr nolan deserves a high profit for his work also mr bale and cowhat i cant get is why i cant shout int the reviews :p okay on a more serious note the dark knight is one of the best superhero movie ever made if not the best movie christopher nolan has produced yet another near perfection movie the plot the story the lines the action everything was near perfect but the real reason of it reach this and im not afraid to say this is heath ledger heaths performance as the joker is what makes this movie perfect christian bale was awesome as well. but let me assure you it is the joker that keeps you at the edge of your seat a near perfect movie and an inspiring performance as the joker by heath must watchwhat i can say is this is a really great movie. it tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. you will succeed in the end. and also be ready at any time. maybe it is because of language problem i dont grasp it very well in the beginning. but step by step i understand it. and in the end i understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies i have ever seen in the past. and also the performance skill is another thing i like it. they are good actors. and this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic but still give people good feelings. great movie encourage you while entertaining you  also for the perfect story. peter jackson has showed everybody that he can do the lord of the rings from book to movie. i will also give some credits to the best writer ever: jrr tolkien. he was in the beginning a ordinary teacher until he write a little sentence: once upon a time there was a hobbit who lived in the shire. this little hobbit was bilbo bagger. but back to the movie this is the best movie ever been made. viggo mortensen is fantastic as the role aragorn. but dont he have more beard in the end of the film than in the beginning. but the actor that i think is the greatest in the lord of the rings company is sean astin alias samwise gamgi. he make his performance so fantastic. the emotions is really coming forward here. i love the scene when sam takes frodo on his back to carry him the last steps in to the fires of mount doom: i cant carry it for you the ring... but i can carry you so finally i just want to say: this is the greatest movie in the modern history... what has been said that hasnt been said before the story the characters the music the special effects the visual effects the cinematography the source material the endings the plot in a nutshell: frodo and sam are on mordors footsteps with the doubtful intentions of gollum leading them. meanwhile sauron is angry at the heir of isildur and sets to attack gondor. the greatest battle scene ever conceived and made takes place. but its not the end. the good guys win the battle but the war is still on. frodo has been betrayed by gollum and left to die with shelob. he survives but unconscious and is taken right into mordor by patrolling orcs. there after being rescued by sam they set off to mount doom to destroy the ring. but in order to distract saurons eye from witnessing all of this aragorn and company set a fight in front of the the imposing black gate. theyre more than positive that they will lose. but frodo fights and falls repeatedly until he gets right above the fire. when hes about to turn away as the ring always manage to do gollum appears and fights frodo for it. thankfully the once hobbit falls with the ring in hand and both are melted in the lava. mordor sauron and the orcs are destroyed. the good guys win. aragorn is crowned but it is he who bows to the hobbits for their services were even greater then what anyone could have ever done. this is where you can turn off the tv stop the dvd or change the channel. the rest is just frodo saying goodbye. my opinion i loved the movie never in the history of film-making there will be a fantasy movie as original engaging universal and pure fun as the lord of the rings. im not sure if peter jackson had in his mind that the movie would be the ultimate epic that it has become. this chapter is the best in the three. yes the many endings drag but at least when i saw it in the theater i didnt want it to end seriously. the  here goes all out. while it has the same dramatic touch from the previous it bigger in scope even the simplistic boy chant when gollum contemplates the ring for the last time is epic and ecstatic. i personally would have ended the movie with the final shot on minas tirith and a pan on the map of middle earth. a beautiful perfect scene. the rosie cotton loose end had to be tied up i think because people wouldnt think sam and frodo had more than friendship which due to the sociological contamination of the media is rather ambiguous. but even as it has some drawbacks these arent enough to take away any stars from this pictures rating. it has made history and it has become the star wars for a new generation not even the prequels could imitate the impact this new trilogy had. best fantasy movie ever this is not a naive statement that will pass on whenever another fantasy movie is made. its for real. you can just feel astonished. how can a movie be that great  audio/sound: 10/10 return of the king deserves much praise for its auditory work making the viewer really enjoy this movie. audio/music is a very important part of a movie and this movie certainly reaches sky-high on that level. every bit of music and sound mixing fits extremely well with the scenes in which they have been placed. editing: 10/10 with a very few exceptions the editing done for rotk is close to flawless. it does not get confusing to watch neither is it boring or slowed down at any time. the pace is done with the mind of a perfectionist. you are kept on your toes throughout the movie. visual effects: 10/10 although not completely perfect there is not any moment of bad effects which would have made many disappointed. they are in fact extremely well done and deserve 10/10. screenplay: 10/10 the screenplay writers deserves extremely much praise for what has been achieved. when watching the movie everything seemed to fit perfectly well. screenplay is a very important part of any movie and in comparison to rotk no movie i have ever watched comes close to it. directing: 10/10 peter jackson is a perfectionist and he boldly takes on one of the hardest directing jobs possible and he succeeds the lotr-trilogy is beyond doubt the best that has ever been made and rotk is its crowning masterpiece. acting performances: 10/10 there is no best acting ensemble but there is best performances by an acting ensemble and in rotk everyone does a truly amazing job. there is a harmony in the ensemble and all are clearly doing the best that they can. every actor glows in the scenes which they are a part of and makes the movie ever so much more enjoyable. 10/10 art design: 10/10 every detail from minor to major is done to perfection. we really get a feel that this is middle-earth which is not by any means an easy job. in this movie this remains one of the most important aspects and is done beautifully. costume designs: 10/10 as with the art design this is also done to perfection. we really see middle-earth and with very much thanks to the clothing and costumes. make-up/hair: 10/10 this too plays an important role and is of course extremely well done. from the beautiful elf to the ugly orc all is congruent and we believe what we see to be middle-earth. summary: what we have here is a movie that is done with careful perfection and a loving heart and with the utmost respect for the novel by j.r.r. tolkien. the achievements of every part of the movie is undeniably close to perfection and what we are left with is a stunning experience that will leave marks on anyone seeing it. it is no exaggeration to call this movie the greatest of all time and the evidence is there for all of us to see. you dont have to enjoy the story to see that what is created is a masterpiece of movie-making. this is the only movie i have seen that deserves a 10/10 overall and i am in fact surprised that it is not above all others at the top-list of imdb. but on top of the list or not this is the best work ever done in the motion picture market and has made movie-making into an art what do you get if you take all the garbage out of the low budget movies and glue it all together yep you guessed it - pulp fiction the ultimate movie of my generation. one could call it the bible for film freaks. if you didnt see it yet read no more just go and buy it or rent it whatever. and if you dont like it go see it again and again if necessary.what can i say...the only film to make a grown man cry no film comes close to this in any way or formit draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene.enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump. what can i say.. this was the best batman movie ever.. what performances the details in this movie were superb. coming from an audio background myself the detail in the sounds design and post-production was incredible. i can only imagine the amount of tracks necessary to create the effects and foley. my hats off to all the cgi folks. i really look forward to great graphics and they did just that. for those that have been watching batman movies for decades the villain played by mr. ledger will make you tremble with fear. the way he truly developed and embraced this character is unreal.. he became the joker. i always having a saying.. you are good as your last work its a shame it was his last. this movie is one to buy and keep as a collectible. go get itwhat can i say this is perfect see it twice or more every time you watch it you will discover new fancy details in the picture or hear a new line that somehow wasnt there the first time thats all there is to be said about that enjoy the perfect movie  in another story he is with his partner jules winnfield samuel l jackson trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to marcellus wallace  in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of butch coolidge bruce willis a fighter who works marcellus wallace which after a fight which was supposed to lose he tries to flee the country with his french girlfriend fabienne maria de medeiros many other characters form the movie mixing in stories each one with a different theme but all have something alike long dialogs the film features unprecedented writing addresses several topics some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is quentin tarantino despite having had help from roger avary on the screenplay this time but all the ideas are still from tarantinos mind keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence the film with so many stories tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters a legendary film excellent performances perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining undoubtedly the best tarantino film a classic and a legendary masterpiecewhat can i say quentin tarantino changed something in movies and this and resoirvor dogs was the ones that put him on the map now i must say this is a harsh movie it shows stuff thats rarely shown in films it is also realistic and heck even funny at times this is a good definition of a good film its well made its well written and its provocative its not the kind of film you turn on on a saturday night for some fun but if you like film you must watch this but i warn you its r rated for a reason i guess the expression can you handle the real world really makes sense in this movie so if your a film buff and you havent seen this what are you waiting for i give this film a 10/10what can i say its shaw shank. i dont refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what im on about when i say its my favourite and i only seen it in april 2012. the story is well known as andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red played by the awesome morgan freeman. over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. how did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. how i dont know how and i dont care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well years later people discovered it on vhs. i wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. a discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it it is more than just good. i may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot. i didnt cry at the end i smiled at the end. what a film. the good of the film the acting from freeman. although he lost to hanks in forrest gump for best actor i donwhat can i say about this movie that hasnt already been said it proves that good acting writing editing and a kick-ass soundtrack are the perfect ingredients to make a superb and refreshing film its just one of those films you can watch over and over and never get bored with it from the memorable dialogue to the unique and impressionable characters  this movie has it all if you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out this truly is american film making at its finest what can i say about this movie i think anyone who watch the movie can say the same cause theres only one word to define this movie: perfection. maybe everybody wont think that but remember: perfection is different for each one of us...what can i add to all the other reviews here just my own feelings about this. i now realise i watched the film in one of the hardest times emotionally i can remember in my life. thoughts chasing themselves around in my head heartbroken paranoid and not well physically. total mess. my dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. i initially resisted thinking it was going to be lightweight pc fare. i dont know why i thought that. theres a lacklustre opening sequence -i think. then you get to see what kind of performance morgan freeman is going to turn out this time and you start to be interested. then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison and i think by then youre hooked. this scene is deeply moving not least because of the music. its difficult to see how thomas newmans music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in its own right but when you do youre reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun enjoying their first beer for so long. theyve been touched by andys kindness. sometimes a kindness is thrown back in ones face but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like haywood getting up and offering andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. the film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. but it is also full of joy and fun and hope. to capture all the above in a film is a triumph. i started watching the film fairly closed to feeling but as i watched the end i could not contain my tears unusually. so a moment when a film came along at the right time for me and no doubt for many otherswhat a narration..one of my all time favorites. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.what a movie what an end to a simply superb trilogy take a bow peter jackson. the return of the king is all what you expect in a movie brilliant story brilliant acting brilliant scenic locations brilliant war sequences and a brilliant ending. it is a visual treat even for the blind. the story starts or rather continues with frodo sam and sjmeagol continuing on their journey towards and into mordor for the ultimate purpose of destroying saurons one ring while aragorn and company fight it out to protect minas tirith along with the help of rohan. the sheer magnitude of some scenes takes you by surprise such is the scale of this project and jackson executes it to perfection. the landscapes are gigantic the scenes are breath-taking especially the lighting of the beacons. inspiring to say the least the performance of viggo mortensen as aragorn is perfect. when he says for frodo and my friends you bow to no one it sounds so classy simple and yet so sublime. and what follows is a speechless moment of vigor determination and hope and trust. sean astin as samwise gamgee steals the show towards the end. his performance was nothing short of authentic and complete. his loyalty and friendship towards frodo is depicted beautifully with lovely dialogs and sequences. special appreciation also to the creation of sjmeagol the creature who seeks the ring. his character has been aptly shown on the screen and one can only admire the lengths of effort put in. all in all the return of the king is a success. it is much more than just a movie. it has been a revolution of visual cinema in a way that has inspired many fantasy books and movies from the era of j.r.r. tolkein. the film is complete with the battle at minas tirith one of the best movie scenes ever to be made. it is long a joy to watch and a bigger enjoyment to watch again. the background  is splendid especially towards the end when frodo nearly reaches the foothills of mount doom and proceeds towards the depths along with sam. this movie will move many hearts and win even more. very few movies of this caliber come and go every year let alone a decade and to miss this saga would be a fools idea. without any hesitation a supreme 10 / 10.what a movie i have never seen a movie like this one. i have never been so confused or amused like this before. this movie has everything. so many great moments. i enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it and every time i watch it.what a great live action version of the classic fairytale this was a great reminder of the good old innocent days back then when people were not so cynic and faced things with open heart a great retelling full of strong emotions and a great message that if u are kind and u believe u can win the battle of life on the plus side the movie also had a great soudtrack so get the dvd when its out plus the cd soundtrack lily james was the second best cinderella candidate after kimberly matula and since kimberly was not given the role then lily was the next perfect choice all in all a great fairytale for the new generation and for the adults to remember their past innocent childhood days dont miss this movieit will make yourelive the old dayswhat a great experience. this movie capped off a 3-year journey for me - one that included my first time reading the books including the hobbit and the silmarillion and several viewings of the movies. each movie holds a special place in my heart but i think that this last one is the most satisfying. ill forever remember the beacons being lit and pippens sorrow-filled song. probably the most poignant moment though is gollums look as he gets to hold the ring one last time... and then the eagles coming... as a whole i feel ive accomplished something coming out of this experience. id like to thank the movie-makers for this experience... for it truly has been fulfilling and life changing.what

zoom-out in the end. the actors are all great but morgan freeman and tim robbins really do outstanding performances. this is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasnt seen it theres only one thing i can say: please do you wont be disappointed.weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the dark knight. weve seen joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. this is the first time i can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. for as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. between all the punches explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. all the actors have their moments. bales batman is the definitive batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve luscious foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling. as for heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the joker. but you have to also recognize jonathan and chris nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. its not just the fact that ledger makes the joker so menacing but the nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. the jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. the nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why ledgers performance is so great. this isnt an action movie. its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy. yes listen to the dialog because its all in there.were still pioneers weve barely begun our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us mankind has finally used up all of earths resources and it has become a dying planet when cooper mcconaughey and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of nasa they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race i have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part i have found it easy to talk about every movie this one i cant seem to find the right words for the reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie there are some movies that words just cannot do justice to the last one i felt that way about was the passion of the christ this is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say its just not enough i loved gravity and this was 1000 times better overall really nothing i can say about this movie other than watch it christopher nolan is a genius i easily give this an a+well...lets just say im 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. not many words can describe lord of the rings some of them maybe mesmerising unbeilevable...but for me it was pro bely the most effecting movie i have ever witnessed. when i watch it i always get goosebumps...always never once have i not been star struck by it. now to all of you tolkien haters out there who call lotr nerdy lets just say f*** you now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. now i admit that there are too many endings6 to be precise but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.well what can i say. this makes batman begins seem terrible. christian bales batman/bruce wayne is on top form and better than everespecially with the scene involving the jump off the ifs in hong kong. i would hugely recommend that you watch this film. ive seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. heath ledgers joker was fantastic. he brought humour and action to the whole film. i must say that ledgers joker has to be better than nicholsons 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. anyway this film had it all - the action - the jokes. the storyline was great. it showed the jokers rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. especially with the party crash scene the street scene where the tumbler explodes : but there is a surprise at this point and when gotham general hospital has some structural re-modifications  gets blown up. the ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. absolutely brilliant just like the cast and the director. what more can i saywell what can i say but freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. powerful poignant thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. the shawshank redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.an amazing movie. easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well i have not read stephen kings novella his first non-horror but some of the movies deficiencies such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. this is the end of the lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end but this film is absolutely epically epic. this film leads where the two towers left off with the evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while frodosam and gollum head to mordor. everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from rohan and gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. there isnt much more to say about this film but see it as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography action drama and action. a film for the ages.well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... i recommend it to every person its a classic that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyesfinally i have seen a movie that is so much better than titanicwell the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... i recommend it to every person its a classic that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyeswell let me start off by saying i felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think to you people i write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so i have given it as such. as for the movie i cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion it is the only movie to date i could watch again and again and not get tired of watching it the cast was spot on everything was perfect the subjugation of the prisons by captain hadley all of it was simply spot on honestly speaking i dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is well deserving of its number 1 spot on imdb. also i read that people dont understand how andy pinned the pictures to his wall it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.well in the lotr book the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears and the death of saruman was not like a deleted scene in the dvd version and then there was not the feat of legolas of killing an elephant so easily and then sam never held frodo hanging on a cliff_ã_ there are many points of bitter criticism of the film and many are true. but do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film no they will never do. the siege of minas tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. the final battle near mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. the brilliant array of talents of weaving mortensen wood tyler serkis urban wenham astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. the film has stood the test of time and any time you see the sauron fall you feel elation pride joy and great triumph. the good has won again and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins it will reign for ever and ever. the final scene of the film with the parting of bilbo and frodo together with the great elves and gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. many films may be made on the eternal novel of mr. tolkien but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. the road goes ever on.well if you read the title this is what all this review about this movie about a writer who creates a story to punish her husband and everybody believe it but the reality that the writer of the movie is the one who cheated everybody by taking an old story and republish it fixing all the problems and weakness of it throwing the original into trash i watch tons of movies but im not that kind who always write a review about it the creators of this movie make me wanna write a review about it and even read the book after that its a really shocking reality when both husband and wife are victims and guilty at the same time and this is what life all about but does the punishment was fair or was it too much  this is what you going to decide after you watch this great story well i guess im a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. ive seen it a couple of times but that was before i became a regular contributor to the imdb. when i first discovered this site a few years ago the godfather was in the number #1 spot and since then the films have traded places for first and second with shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. that puzzled me a bit until i watched it again tonight and ive come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. my favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way shape or form and my personal top ten list includes titles like on the waterfront to kill a mockingbird and one flew over the cuckoos nest. i may have to reconsider that list an infrequent exercise but one i dont mind doing every now and then as situations warrant. overall the film is darn near perfect. i know its pretty clichê© to state it that way but when you analyze the dialog the characters the directing and the tone of the movie the picture flows flawlessly even when it detours into side stories like brooks hatlens release and new prisoner tommys introduction late in the picture. every set-up every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize andys quest for escape and personal redemption. remember brooks feeding jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon how about andy playing mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. the story transcends one mans confinement for a crime he didnt commit and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. paul newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967s cool hand luke but his method was self destructive. andy dufresne tim robbins never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so. but even more so you have here the story of ellis boyd redding morgan freeman a convict who sees andy as a person and over time an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. from andy he comes to understand that even as a prisoner a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. not bad for a convict who started out believing that hope can drive a man insane. i really cant recommend this picture highly enough both for its masterful story telling and its technical execution. the actors even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. they deliver a seamless performance thats virtually unmatched by most modern films in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.well i didnt had any high expectations when i watched this movie but damnthis is one hell of a moviethis movie is very well safe in my top 5 favorite movie of all time as far as i remember this is the only movie that i didnt want it to end even when the duration is almost 3 hours this movie maybe didnt have much action or explosion but the dialogues are enough to keep you glued seriously i think that is what hollywood movies are lacking nowadayssuch entertaining and wonderful dialogues/conversation all of the cast did a great job in this movie and i think the one that really stand out is sam jackson and i think you all know why when you watch it and i pretty much enjoy the non- linear plot style that is shown in this movie i feel pity for anyone who still havent watch this movie or anyone who considered this movie as boringi remember when its about to end i was like nooo dont end yetsuch an addicting moviea great masterpiece that will live throughout the ageswell here it is one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. how was it it was excellent. by far the best batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. everyone was waiting to see how well heath ledger performed as the joker in this film. he definitely deserves an oscar in his honor. the character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. compared to heaths other films like 10 things i hate about you and even brokeback mountain proves that this man could actually act doesnt matter what character he could do it. the films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding the story is developed constantly after each scene making you wonder whats next. excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. during the film on the scene with batman against the joker bike vs truck. people thought this was the ending. no it kept going which was awesome the story kept getting darker and darker i guess thats why they called it the dark knight as well as the relation to batman himself. the cast was great. with christopher nolan playing batman good performance heath ledger played extremely well maggie was annoying at times but still deserves to be praised. michael caine and morgan freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. aaron eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch. great directing made the movie enjoyable they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful lighting was done well especially showing harvey/ two faces face in the many moods he displayed. great explosions made it entertaining. made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time. this movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor heath ledgers life. may he r.i.p his performance made what this film is right now. i recommend this film for any action fan especially a batman fan. or if your even a heath ledger fan. go ahead right now and see this film. its greatwell folks thats how its done ever thought mi6 note thats what the british call their secret service is a club for snobbish upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? ok bond is kind of cool i hated the last two though but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level not since district 9 have i had that feeling during the watching of a film like this movie just does everything right by which i mean of course it plays exactly to my taste compared to this film every james bond movie released after licence to kill looks like a snorefest this is such a kickass balls against the wall crazy ride that i had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening i was invited to and i actually knew what i was in for ive seen every film by matthew vaughn but i was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one thought kickass was pretty crazy? wait till you see this one of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors the well known stars all play against type which makes this even more unreal remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like bridget jones? he just won an oscar for playing the stuttering king of england and as you will see in kingsman that oscar was well deserved that dude colin firth can play anything hes more badass in this than bond ever was a word to the wise though this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish it is a comedy but a very very violent kind of comedy and the language alone will shock the mpaa out of their pants watch this if youre into films like lock stock kickass or in bruges and youll probably love it  dont bother if youre more into serious films or family friendly comedies as for me i had a bloody good timewell directed well produced love the photography and the script is amazing quentin tarantino is one of my preferred directors and the pulp fiction was the first film from tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work the arc of this script is super well created once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie the photography of this movie is also amazing very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie the characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast about tarantinos direction there nothing that i can tell  in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax at the right moment one of the best movies i have ever seenwell as the other more than 2000 review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. it basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward. oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it. this is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. other films that moved me like this: forrest gump the curious case of benjamin button. imdb says i have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xdweary beyond words hobbit companions frodo and sam continue their journey to destroy the one ring with the sinister gollum still their guide. the film opens interestingly with gollums origin story capturing his descent into depravity and madness finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. the ring has the power to affect its bearer and not for good. with the battle of helms deep over and sarumans power gone the attention focuses on the capital of gondor minas tirith. there the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy while those visible are more of a threat than ever. the return of the king in its way is as much aragorns story as it is frodoswe have all see movies comedies action and dramas. we all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it. in shawshank redemption  the french new wave or blaxploitation the wild bunch or the brady bunch its all grist. we are in an age where the audience can choose to view a film featuring 3-dc.g.i. and special effects. the audience may also choose to find a film which has a solid story line a remarkable plot and surprises in an unpredictable series of events. but you cant have both. this is the general rule...however with the exception of the dark knight and only a few others all of these effects seem to be necessary to attain this culmination of an a+ plot direction acting and production. definitely in my top 3 list of all time favorites. thank you to everyone who was able to make this film what it is. one thing that makes this film special is its unique ability to stand alone as a solid film without ever seeing the prequel or sequel.we all remember how good batman begins was right well after seeing the much anticipated and hyped sequel begins is childs play. good evening ladies and gentlemen. were tonights entertainment... the action kicks off with a bank heist that brings back memories of michael manns excellent heat a feeling that lingered for the entire movie and more-or-less introduces us to the joker. now believe me when i say that the joker is completely mental. heath ledgers performance is brilliant. theres talk of an oscar nomination something which is very much deserved. he completely disappears into his character perfecting the best screen villain since hannibal lecter. just check out the scene with the pencil... the joker prefers the slow kill. he is tortured by his sinister smile and when you hear how he got it it will send shivers down your spine. but the thing that is truly sinister about him is hes not into crime for the money. the joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can. this city deserves a better class of criminal... and im gonna give it to them with praise for the joker out of the way its time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime thriller. morgan freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles he was god once for christs sake maggie gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland katie holmes as batmans long time friend and love interest rachel dawes nestor carbonell of lost fame nails the gotham city mayor and the awesome michael caine is you guessed it awesome as batmans trusty butler alfred. another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all of these characters even alfred whos often just a plot device in previous batman movies. the night is darkest just before the dawn. and i promise you the dawn is coming... following the opening heist we see everyones favourite troubled millionaire bruce wayne christian bale cinemas definitive batman in his bat-suit once again cleaning the streets of gotham before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop james gordon gary oldman reprising his rare good guy role from begins that it would be wise to work with the citys district attourney harvey dent aaron eckhart perfectly cast in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. this begins a series of events that brings batman to the attention of the joker who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of gotham first targeting various authority figures including the mayor and dent. so what are you proposing its simple: kill the batman... to say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film but there is one other key point of this film and that is the dramatic rise and fall of harvey dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation into harvey two-face... you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain... all in all this film is perfectly written there are action scenes a-plenty but they dont interfere with the extraordinary character development contains brilliant performances all round especially the power-house performance by heath ledger directed with confidence and gusto by christopher nolan and is darkly funny for the most part but takes itself very seriously when it comes to the drama. know your limits master wayne. batman has no limits. the verdict: the dark knight is stunning. it will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties if not all time. it twists the standard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. in a word: perfect.watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good. a film without special effects and action every 5 minutes just men in prison. all i can say is i would have loved this film to have been longer. the acting from morgan freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.watching this great movie for the second time i remember some of the best times i had as a moviegoer especially as a kid. i remember watching the original star wars series with a serious amount of amazement. raiders of the lost arc gave me a great sense of adventure. and the first jaws scared the hell out of me. all these movies and others like them provided something for me to remember. in addition they were just plain fun movies. not pretentious overwrought or just plain dumb. most of todays movies are just plain nonsense. they have no heart like they used to. they are all made for the sole purpose of making a buck. although i am sure that new line cinema would love to make billions on this series and peter jackson and his people are being paid well for their efforts that does not prevent these movies from being great works of art and just plain fun. i remember reading these books as a kid and i have always loved them and wanted somebody to do a proper adaptation of them. now that the final book has been brought to the big screen we can see the entire series from a new perspective and i for one admire it more than i ever have. it would have been easy for jackson and co. after the success of fellowship to just give people a shortened version of the last two books with teasers here and there but no substance. but he has not done this. return of the king is the best example of this. in this movie jackson has made a movie that works very well with the books and finds the most essential parts of it to make a movie that works on just about every level. from the scenery in new zealand to the look of the battles i felt as if i was there to the incomparable computer effects of gollum and the equally amazing effects of shelob ever part was filmed with a care to the details that the books deserved. the dialog in this movie is also much better than in two towers. i loved this movie from the first scene of how smeagol finds the ring of power to the last frame of sam closing his door in the shire. back to what i was saying at the top. very few movies today give me a sense of wonder that i had as a kid. this series certainly does this. from the beginning to the end the movies are a stunning achievement and worthy of any awards it receives.watch it right now because of the great acting by the leads watch it right now because of the awesome plot watch it right now because of the feeling it leaves you with you feel terrible and cheated upon watch it right now because of the ending watch it right now because of the mystery that fills the air and clouds your brain while you are watching it watch it right now so that you know how crazy can girls get and yours isnt half as crazy watch it right now because i have given you enough reasons as to why you should just watch it right now warning contains adult scenes it may disturb childrenwatch 10 movies before you die and you are at right place all the characters are beautifully executed in the movie specially ving rhames has done an amazing job while bruce willis was outstanding no doubt john travolta and samuel jackson beautifully played their characters uma thurman was at her best tim roth was very good at his small character this movie is totally memorable all the characters were like alive even a small role of zed was noticeable music was amazing to listen and it even brought john travolta dancing last but not least quintin tarantino was there to witness about the beauty of the moviewas a great movie  i love the story and the actors were fantastic. there is so much to say about this movie. but look seriously look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. the movie picture is very good. good angles of shooting always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. and finally check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. see the movie enjoy and learn to finish just saying that it as a great movie oh wait i already said that no problem its to highlight the idea.warning: may contain spoilers im glad youre here sam here at the end of all things i found that this particular line near the conclusion of the film struck a note inside me. not only as one of my favorite lines from tolkiens work but also as a sad reminder that the trilogy has drawn to a close. no more will the rush of anticipation fill me as another december approaches heralding the arrival of another of peter jacksons masterworks. the most monumental of the three films the return of the king also evokes the strongest impact within me. it represents the culmination of years of the most careful work that brought one of the most epic stories into cinema history. ill begin with the obvious strong points of the movie. the effects are absolutely stunning. as you have read countless times previous the battle of the pelennor fields is one of the most exhilerating thrill rides and certainly one of the grandest film battles. my mouth was agape even the third time viewing the rohirrim stare in horror amidst the low rumble of the charge of the gargantuan mamukil during the winged fell beasts diving into the white city of minas tirith and the arrival of the army of the dead. in subtler aspects cgi has been used masterfully to craft a thoroughly convincing and memorable performance of a key character. the marriage of andy serkis acting and the impecable craft of weta animators created a gollum worthy of remembrance. the settings are dazzling particularly the psychedelic green glow of the foreboding minas morgul minas tirith itself and the atmospheric horror of shelobs lair. mordor is the true hell of middle earth as the strongholds of men are the light. the acting though starkly shakespearean at times is particularly effective. the relationship between frodo and sam is brought to the forefront powerfully conveying that the most important thing driving these characters through the most evil of places is their friendship. miranda otto is given a chance to shine as eowyn the caged warrior who finally gets an opportunity to fight for those she cares for. her confrontation with the witch king promulgated by the line i will kill you if you touch him never ceased to send a shiver down my spine. though wooden at times the acting successfully moves the gears of the film. without the burden of having to establish many characters and settings as the first two films did the return of the king allows development of many characters who were initially marginalized. billy boyd is particularly effective this time around as pippin. howard shores musical  is once again stirring as ever molding a grandness of scale with the closeness and conflict of relationships. the sound design is equally awe inspiring: the nazgul shrieks and grinding stone of a collapsing city never fail to elicit a response. yes there are shortcomings. many very interesting scenes from the book didnt make the final theatrical cut. the confrontation with saruman and the scouring of the shire are two notable examples. however although i have been a tolkien enthusiast since i first read the books when i was 8 or 9 years old i do not share the cynicism of many reviewers. apart from the obvious reason that the films run-time already exceeds 3 hours there is a simple question of interpretation. certain sacrifices needed to be made to craft a feasible film for the movie going public. furthermore this is merely a certain group of peoples vision of the books. we all have different images of middle earth in our minds. the fact that a scene is left out of a movie does not necessarily make it a poor or insufficient telling of a story. i find it interesting for example that hardly any reviewers of star wars criticized the movie for having not contained scenes from lucas original book. it positively surprised me that so many people have read and enjoyed these fabulous books to offer such valid comments out of their love for the trilogy. im sure that the dvd extended edition will please the palate of anyone who was disappointed with the removal of certain scenes. in conclusion this film is a gorgeous reminder that cgi can enhance a movie-going experience without sacrificing the human element of film. i am wholly satisfied with peter jacksons vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of three of my favorite novels to the screen.warning spoiler alert which actually isnt a spoiler but i am just doing this so i wont get black listed now to start off what i love about this movie is that it skewers conventional thinking in almost every aspect of the film and does not just skewer it but it unleashes an entire swath of that could be possible type stuff into the films very amazing plot warning warning not so much a spoiler alert ahead while most people usually find it offensive to kill a head of state i find it refreshing to see directors who arent afraid to go there sort of speak but trust me it goes there pretty well wink wink the movie itself is filled with an elaborate but easy to follow storyline with uncanny plot twists and unexpected you kinda understand but kinda hate him bad guys kinsmen will remain in my heart one of the best and most unapologetic spy films i have ever seen just a heads up if you are in any ways biased towards politics of conservative liberal progressive green republican or any kind of ends justify the means marxist kinda politics this movie isnt for you so my word of advice is to pretend for about 2 hours that your not associated with any politics what so ever and enjoy the filmwalking more walking gandalfs back b****es suck on dat orc pee pee some more walking a battle i can smell the c**t of sauron i like the luscious hair on gandalf and

but the restaurant doesnt turn out to be as easy as the other places theyve robbed i cant say anything about this film that no one hasnt said before but the film is phenomenal its groundbreaking and its one of the coolest films ever to be released in the nineties but why is it its because its flawless seamless and no matter how many times you see the movie and i guarantee you will see it more than five times it never gets boring and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention tarantino has crafted a timeless movie and it will be remembered in years and years and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces alongside citizen kane casablanca and the godfather the cast are impeccable and this film resurrected two flagging careers in willis and travolta especially travolta whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold and its down to this plus dont forget not many people had heard of samuel l jackson before this and after this hes been in nearly every film ever made since and you watch them because you are waiting for that jules winfield magic every scene is wonderful every set piece is perfect and the script is sparkling its pure gold the weak link in the film tarantinos cameo but hey this is his invention so ill let him off one of the last great films ever madevery mild spoilers first off im a huge fan of batman comics cartoons movies etc. and i am delighted with this movie. it has made batman a popular superhero for everyone and is an intense thrilling action packed spectacle. the way two-face comes into play is done very well. heath ledgers joker is fantastic and acting all round is brilliant. there is a lot of excitement and batman is truly a dark knight. the action is very well done and a lot of the time it is different from straight up fighting i cant believe how well it has been done comparing it to previous installments. go watch this movie now. im sure you will love it batman has become cool to a massive audience with this one movie. brilliantvery good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very

action scene lastly great comeback from batmanbruce wayne .nice drama scene ending is a little bit shock but is change to good .i would like to thank you chistopher nolan to help batman series from death in batman and robin that is very bad but you make batman revive again with 3 movies and its wonderful and amazing make me like its very much im very sad because this is last episode of batman that you will do in this series i want to see more batman movie that you direct it . you create a plot of the stories very well in this 3 movies .the enemy of batman like scarecrow joker and bane can fight batman very close and close to win batman but hero is hero for surelyvery good acting exceptionally interesting storyline creating his own ambiance and keeping your attention till the very least scene. john travolta shows hes a great actor and bruce willis always gets the best out a character you have to watch the movie at least two times to get a good view on the whole storyline.very few movies that made me cry ... and the shawshank redemption is certainly one of them. i remember when i first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. the movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship. very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an oscar for their great performance. it is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the imdb top 250 movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation. if you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lotusually i dont want to see a movie more than once in a theater let alone a movie this long. but i just want to see it again as well i cant wait for the extended version to come out on dvd. however i know that it will be a while with how good and popular it is.unlike previous letdowns this year return of the king was excellent. a perfect 10. coming in at 3 and a half hours the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really dont know. the plot acting effects and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time. sean astin deserve atleast a nod if the statue as best supporting actor oscar. elijah wood could recieve a nod for best actor. this movie will definately win best effects best musical  and could win best movie this year at the oscars. it was that good. you should go see it right now. stop staring at the computer screen and go. this movie is that good.undoubtedly one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. the outstanding performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting. the film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. i am left questioning the state of our justice system. we lock away these threats to society alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. then when they have served their life terms we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. the shawshank redemption tells a very powerful story. a story that made me laugh and cry. it ignited just about every human emotion i could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time. a truly amazing film 10 out of 10 from meun predictable amazing film that is the only word to express this whole movie it is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown for example when trabolta not sure with his names spelling carries uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug multitude of people would think that uma would die and trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what they success saving uma and did uma told the boss whole this nope she kept her mouth shut did this scene affect the story not at all everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie it was just the part of beginning but the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small storys elements are totally unpredictable how is this possible cause it is tarantinos film no respect for girls violence no respect for views visual he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors cant have thats the power of the bravery you better watch this awesome film as fast as possibleumm i am speechless or in this case typeless to not even describe how this movie is. there is a turn at every corner and i mean awesome freaking out heart stopping scary stuff. also there are several beautiful visual effects going on here like the spectacular batman-jumps-out-of-window- into-plane-with-chinese-crook-in-hand stunt. that was awesome. the hospital explosion was great as well and harvey dies if you watched the first movie then prepare to get your shoes socks and everything blown off then this is the movie for you. i really sorry that heath ledger died though. he was a great actor in this movie. just watch it dont hesitate watch it. good luck.two hours and forty minutes summarize twelve years of a boys life the director richard linklater began this project in 2002 shooting one week per year linklater was able to show in a simple way the personality of a man being formed something never seen in cinemas for sure the screenplay is simple and doesnt appeal for melodrama even with dramatic moments they are always short scenes after all these moments happen in everybodys life but they always pass the simplicity of the screenplay is one of the biggest achievements of the movie without expository dialogues it totally convinces the audience but that happens because of the actors too mason the protagonist is interpreted by ellar coltrane his performance is very natural it is very interesting and touching the way that he grows up and discovers life its one of the subtleties of the movie beside mason the film ends up showing the story of the characters who are related to him patricia arquette is his mother the way that she transmits the growing of the character is impeccable other actor who is excellent in this film is ethan hawke masons father the dialogues between father and son are very natural which beatle is the best? are they going to make another star wars? etc richard linklaters direction is very good either first of all its necessary to highlight his courage and patience to realize such project the movie has some gorgeous sequenceshots some of them are even repeated as a narrative technique richard creates a very beautiful visual message the soundtrack is great too beside of memorable and touching the songs help to situate the audience in time for example the movie begins with coldplays yellow showing us that we are in 2002 boyhood is a movie like no other it is impossible not identify with at least one moment of masons life for that reason the innovation as a cinematographic work the direction details and the simplicity of the screenplay boyhood is a memorable movie one of the best if not the best of the yeartruly a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe and faithful to its comics guardians of the galaxy does more than entertain the audience it takes the viewers to this level of awesomeness in a rather messy manner but its totally worth sitting through rocket and groot were my personal favorites i love the way the makers filled this movie with humor and style this is perhaps one of the strongest movies of 2014 along with marvels captain america the winter soldier perhaps slightly better depends on how you wanna look at it also id like to add that this movie is oscar worthy dont get me wronggroot is the best animated feature of the year so far and the visual effects were also pretty impressive only time will tell if this movie can maintain it i also love the fact that they are linked to the avengers via thanos if you havent watched it already go see it asaptruly a masterpiece. this film was more than worthy of its 11 oscars. the fellowship was stunning the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. the thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. i myself have read the lord of the rings by tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. peter jackson i feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray tolkiens vision. without a doubt the speech roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. people say the ending is too long i say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.toward the beginning of the film bruce willis face appears inside the sleaziest of bars in the san fernando valley but instead of the self-confident and wise-cracking characters he played in moonlighting and die hard he dons a very different mask we notice willis is not speaking but listening listening to a voice of authority played by a lesser-known actor ving rhames as some kind of underworld kingpin and then we understand willis is listening to a superior willis nods and speaks very little  he is subservient to this voice and the willis we have come to know is no longer willis but a pawn in a much larger game in which he does not wield much power this is one of my favorite scenes with willis showing his range as an actor and being able to descend from higher stardom into the lower depths of humility we learn that willis is being paid off for some kind of act the envelope containing the payoff money is presented by the kingpin whose face is yet unseen just as he is about to hand the goods over he immediately jerks it back willis does not try to grab the payment but sits patiently waiting for the superior to hand him the goods willis knows he cannot have the payment until the superior is ready and willing to give it to him the gesture is a symbolic reminder of who is really in power and its not willis willis humble scene captures well the flavor of the entire film called pulp fiction a masterpiece of sub-culture drama but definitely not for all tastes characters and story are all spontaneous these people live on the edge on the darker periphery of american reality instead of going to football matches they kill people in sporting events instead of having drinks at the hilton they overdose on intense psychedelics and if they arent careful they may end up either on the business end of some hit mans 45 or in a remote dungeon where people are into s & m this is certainly not for those whose favorite movie is the sound of music and their favorite music is sung by doris day samuel jackson and john travolta play two hit men in service to the kingpin underworld lord but they never discuss their missions instead they banter about all kinds of irrelevant subjects like the names for american burgers on the menu in paris this chit-chat is a breath of fresh air and probably a lot more realistic than other films in which characters are discussing the plot ad infinitum the hit mens stories intersect with another plot line involving bruce willis a boxer who is on the take from the same underworld lord to throw a fight but these are just the bare bones throughout the film the hit men the boxer and the kingpin weave an intricate tapestry of plots and subplots told in a non-linear style part of the beauty of pulp fiction that ranks it one of the most innovative of films is that it collates as a movie puzzle events occur out of sequence rather than told in a straight linear fashion scenes happen in the middle of the film that are the end of the story the first and last scenes of the whole film which are in my opinion the best are the middle of the story not the end and yet the events of the last half of the first scene are not shown until the very end which turns out to be the last scene of the movie but not the last scene of the story prior to pulp fiction i dont know if there existed any american movies daring enough to pull such cinematic misdirection and make it work some european filmmakers may have done this but rarely such an innovative structure has occurred in american feature films and yet tarantino makes it work and you understand by films end how all the pieces fit together the collation is similar to tarantinos first production reservoir dogs but he takes those innovations to the next degree because of the subject matter not everyone will be able to enjoy pulp fiction but i think thats a mark of a great film which is ironically what hollywood studio executives try to avoid hollywood wants everyone to like a film not just some people but the price paid for this curtailing to everyones tastes is a marked lack of visionary works luckily someone saw the value of pulp fiction and gave it the funding to allow it to happen the result is one of the most tantalizing of cinematic experiences but not the kind of movie youll give your grandmother totally and absolutely wonderful in every way. i could go on and on about the beautiful cinematography how the story was summed up in a very satisfying way and how spectacular the battle scences were but i think that my summary says it all. see it for yourself.tolkien s works had been put into tv with animation by rankin/bass 1977 and 1979. in 1978 ralph bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. and now with todays technologyan all-star cast and a fabulous music  new line cinema has brought the the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21th century. each scene has hearta bit of humourheart-thumpin action and excellent effects. and i should like to tell you that rings is what got me to love four of the films stars - elijah woodorlando bloomviggo mortensen and liv tyler. in this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure the war of the ring has began and frodo & sam who are led by gollum continue their dangerous quest to destroy the one ring. but they are unaware of the trap that set for them by gollum. meanwhile aragorn legolas gimli and gandalf are united with merry & pippin at the now destoryed isengard thanks to them treebeard and the other ents. now the friends celebrated their victory. but aragorn was worried of frodo. and in the dead of the night pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at sarumans palantir that was found and confiscated. but something happened the palantir showed him the eye of sauron and that he is planning to attack minas tirithtoday i had the pleasure of experiencing richard linklaters pet project boyhood this is easily the greatest cinematic experience ive had in a long time considering linklater is one of my favorite working directors i am happy to say that high expectations were surpassed this is his best work to date the concept of filming for 12 years couldve easily come off as a gimmick but thankfully linklater who is one of the least selfindulgent and relaxed directors out there uses this ambition with natural depth and substance the 12 year deal is icing on the cake this is top notch filmmaking on a technical and emotional level one of the best traits about linklater is that he never overplays tearjerking situations or gets unrealistically dramatic he really understands the human soul its an epic yet charming honest and down to earth film i feel like just about anybody could resonate with it in some way i can easily see this going down as a universally loved american classic right next to films like 12 angry men pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest i strongly recommend it to everybody its truly a film that deserves to be seen i cant thank everyone involved with making this masterwork enough for being so patient i think it dethrones there will be blood as my favorite film of the 21st century thus far go see itto put it simply this is one of the best movies i have ever seen writer/director quentin tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles drugs and a lot of violence but that just adds to the movie for me the plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable when i turned 40 i did something i always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that i chose for my friends and i to watch was pulp fiction it is at the top of imdbs top 250 and it is on afis top 100 for a reason it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favoritesto call the shawshank redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. this is a film that when i watched it the first time i couldnt believe how good it was. i expected a film that would pass the time by and i got a film that i could identify with. if you are feeling sad and you think the worlds a rubbish place this fills you with hope. i love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison and then the music kicks in it makes you feel awe-inspired. the acting was brilliant you believed what everyone said some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness that it makes you want to throw up. i have watched spiderman and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing they just sound good. the film and book reciprocated the message hope springs eternal which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better things might change for us and hope never dies. i think when tim robbins speaks about music how you can never take it away because its in your head. if i have a rubbish day at work then its true that music just lifts you which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison this of example of piece of script which means so much. the movie uses music to its full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters. this film cannot replicated because the film is a piece of art the director wanted to make money but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something that had some effect on you after the movie was over. the movie has no bad points its what a story should be about it takes you somewhere that you nether been and makes you feel you lived that experience and you can learn from that experience. the lines delivered will always be remembered get busy living or get busy dying this is the dilemma we face in everyday live. this will live in my memories forever not like the sorry cash-ins of movies. this is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.to be honest i enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. you usually get far more character development than in a movie e.g. puzos the godfather. but not with shawshank. this is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. the characters pacing plot monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. brooks suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office e.g. lotr: the return of the king the godfather but an original stand-alone film that in my opinion will never be surpassed in qualityto be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life shawshank redemption is the best movie i have ever seen. the plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. i didnt see it until a few years after it came out. my sister said it was a great movie. it was on hbo so i watched it. i was speechless. i have always found it strange that it was from a steven king novel. ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a steven king novel. a better movie may come along but it may be a while.tim robbins as andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged and sent to the shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit. morgan freeman as red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to andy. in order for andy to help the young man cope with prison as red is really used to it having lived there for years. red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes posters of rita hayworth to andy among other things. as people at the prison look up to him. red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way. both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. as both need to lean on one another to survive. and andy is beaten up by mark rolston as red and his thugs and after red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as andy is no longer bothered again. in the process andy is moved from the laundry job. andy works with the corrupt warden sam nortonplayed evilly by bob gunton and corrupt and sadistic guard captain hadleyclancy brown in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally. andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. who in turn would take away his job and the library he has been working at. as he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. and with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from red to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. he wants something more to do that than. wont tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. a movie of hope and encouragement. as it shows you should never ever give up hope as that keeps you going. robbins and freeman make a great duo. and the chemistry between them looks really real. great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players really you will love this movie if you had not seen it.three renowned actors and my favorite director quentin tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. the amazing actor samuel jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. in addition john travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. moreover john mccain plays a boxer who doesnt take the fall. not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout pulp fiction. theres no dull moments in tarantinos finest work. the story takes the viewer on ride through drug deception murder and everywhere in between. im a little bias towards jackson and tarantino but for any movie lover this is a must watch.this will be a short review not because i do not have time but because of the magnificence it brought to me is in my mind forever more. i remembered seeing this in the cinema of my hometown in sweden it was the best of my life. i had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. a must see for those who have not. even now i feel like a kid again watching it. my childhood of sword-plays with sticks in the forestspretending to be fighting an army of orcs is a truth while watching this with surround sound. the costumes the characters i salute tolkien for this glorious work and salutes jackson for the splendid adventure he has captures on the cinema screenthis was the one movie i had been waiting for all year so i wasnt disappointed when i saw it yesterday. i knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didnt matter to me because i know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. it was fantastic to see aragorn become who he was born to be it was his courage and belief in frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. i think anyone would want someone like sam to be their friend his friendship had more power than the ring itself. i honestly cant decide which of the three are my favourites because i love them all but this definitely is a trilogy that ill never forget.this was the best batman movie ever. rip heath ledger but he brought the joker character to life. i personally would have called it the joker instead of batman because if it wasnt for the joker then the movie would have been boring.however i did enjoy a lot of the action scenes like the opening of the movie when the men with the clown masks were breaking into the bank. also the scene when the joker is trying to kill the comissioner & batman ties the rope around the vehicle & it flips forward. i thought that was a very cool special effect.i wonder if they are going to add robin as batmans side kick in the next one. cant wait to see the next chapter.this was probably my favorite trilogy of all time as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. this last chapter wraps up the story nicely as frodo and sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. this movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the hobbits frodo and sam and gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than aragon gimli and legolos who were more the focus of the last one. this one has epic battles and great visuals as well. it is also very well acted. sean astin does a particularly good job as sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. all in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. i would write more but i am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than i can.this was one of the best movies i have ever seen my dad told me about this movie and at first i was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets i was hooked it does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything there is a perfect balance of action which includes blood shooting and wicked gun fights comedy because lets be honest samuel jackson is just down right hilarious there is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes i would totally recommend this to all of my friends couldnt think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie 10/10 would watch againthis was my first movie ever.i mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching lotryesthe caps is important. i saw it in bahrain first in budaiyafor those of you who dont know where bahrain isfyi beautiful placemust go. anywaysi couldnt believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelandsits a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but i will always have that feeling in my mind that im watching something worthwhile which is better than whats out there nowwith one question. what wouldve happened if i never saw this movie i told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too. i think anyone in the world will agree with me when i say that lotr is the greatest and most respected movie series accompanied by of course the godfather. just ask aguero.and im an arsenal fanthis was a reflection of the count of montecristo especially the jailbreak scene. but still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. this is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from forrestgump and back to the future and all. it also reminded me of the series the oz its cool and all but theres this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in hollywood a lot. probably so but im afraid that not to be true.and one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to whove been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyones favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.this trilogy took my breath away it made me laugh it made me wince it even made my eyes tear up in some parts but in totality what it did was completely blow my mind now lets get to the third chapter - the return of the king. unbelievable i will start with the acting. the entire cast was superb beyond imagination. firstly viggo mortensen again delivers a brilliant performance as aragorn of a king emerging from an outlaw. it has been wonderful to watch his steady transformation over the two previous instalments but it really comes full tilt here. sean astin also deserves special mention as the true hero that has been buried inside samwise gamgee surfaces in the final film navigating some of the films most frightening and suspenseful scenes. reliable as ever is sir ian mckellen as thee wise gandalf and now as general of the gondorian armies. finally worth mentioning is elijah wood and andy serkis. elijah perfectly portrays the pain and weariness of an eroding soul. and as the wonderfully created cgi masterpiece andy serkis brings life to the creature gollum through his movements and voice. next up is the direction and script. oh and how wonderful these aspects are peter jackson surpasses the scope and epic glory of the two astonishing previous chapters to bring us something beyond cinema and beyond epic. the craft with which the new-zeelander constructs this film is amazing. he builds in every aspect necessary to forward the narrative but gives it all ample time to wonderfully unfold. working from a brilliant script written by himself his wife fran walsh and phillipa booyens he creates the utter magic on screen that was so evident in the undeniably majestic literary masterpieces of jrr tolkien. the sweeping  just adds to the epic scope of the film and is so wonderful that it almost becomes a character all by itself. the story follows frodo and sams final steps towards mount doom with their treacherous companion gollum in tow. the other members of the fellowship are gearing up for the final battle of middle earth. aragorn is absent from the preparations while he recruits the army of the dead to fulfill their oath. using anduril which is the narsil after it has been reforged. the battle scenes are even more impressive than the visually stunning battle of helms deep from the two towers. with especially the battle of pelenor fields being up there with the final battle as some of the best battle scenes ever created. in the extended edition look out for the scenes where the terrifying witch - king of angmars true power comes into scope. many have complained about the films multi tiered ending. but to me this is a well deserved farewell to some of our most loved cinema characters. if there was an option to give this trilogy more than 10/10 i would but seeing as this is the highest honor i can bestow on it a 10 shall suffice.this trilogy is the best movie i ever saw. it contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy horror drama action romance some comedy and more. the effects are great and its based on one of the best book i ever read. either the cast is very good chosen. jackson made everything good. it was great as i saw it for the first time. after that i saw the movies about teen times and every time i liked it more and more. i was very happy as i heard the news that the hobbit begun to be filmed and as i saw the first part i was very happy. only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. i cant wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the hobbit.this trilogy is the best ever. i love it  every time i watch those movies i realize that ill never be bored to watch them again. every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplaypicturemakeupfashion design and the exceptional actors that make those movies a cinematic masterpiece and now after 10 years remains just as good from my point of view i think viggo mortensen would have deserved an oscar  best actor  for his role as aragorn  it fits him like a glove . congratulations to peter jackson and his entire team for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie  the hobitt this touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit i have seen. andy dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in shawshank prison. this inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful. when you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph. field of dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me. shawshank redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity. it doesnt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie. it is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others. however the title says it all. redemption is what this story is all about. and it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. what emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art. this is what movies were meant to be.this summer has been the summer of the comic book movie. amazing movies have come out of the genre this summer: iron man hellboy 2 and the incredible hulk from what ive heard to name a few. at a time when people need a hero to usher them through bad times theyve been there for them at the multiplex. weve seen these heroes deal with not only outward demons but inward demons as well anger hate alcoholism drugs etc. but none of them has dealt with them in the way that the dark knight doesthis single film alone qualifies tarantino as a genius excellent cast of characters intriguing dialogue subtle humor superb soundtrack everything it is one of my most favorite movies to watch ever the plot twists are excellent this raises the expectation for any other work that tarantino doesthis second film in the dark knight trilogy shows us the real side of christopher nolans the dark knight. from all of the batman movies and series ever made this is the one who stands out to be best. there is no way of mentioning this film without talking about heath ledgers performance as the joker he is showing us the dark and magnificent side of the joker heath ledger gives possibly his best performance of his life in this movie we have seen jack nicholsen as one joker before but ledger came up with this incredible interpretation of the character not the soft side but the evil explicate character we see in the comics. the tics the mind-blowing plans from the guy who doesnt come up with plans. christian bale is clearly the best batman of my choice he does the dark batman to his own and makes him his dark knight the cooperation bale nolan and ledger have had through this film is incredible making it one of the best films made of my opinion  for a truly excellent game all the elements must come together. everyone involved must have perfect form. director darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. of course the actors were excellent  morgan freeman and tim robbins seldom disappoint. the thing that makes this movie exceptional is that darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. bob gunton and clancy brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than them. the other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: it must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end. so many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. not so with shawshank redemption. just like goldilocks said this is just right buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again.this review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review. sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didnt go well in the box office. shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. it captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. i believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. sometimes life doesnt make any sense at all. some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still wont succeed in their life. these people are forced to the point of desperation. what they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is hope which you should need until the moment you die. if you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.this film has really changed my way of looking the life.this one is by far the best of all batman-movies in my opinion. it has suspense right from the start and keeps you gripped till the end.the acting is simply brilliant. heath ledgers joker is the coolest villain ever and for me it is the best acting performance in the movie history apart that the directing from christopher nolan is amazing. the staging and screenplay is fabulous. you dont want to miss this one out even if you do not like superheroes surely one of the best movies ever. not my personal best but it is definitely in the top 10 so to all you movie lovers: if you have not seen this one yet do it nowthis movie was totally magnificent. peter jackson really shown 3 things he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars it has shown that it is way superior than the books and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. this movie won everything it was nominated for eleven and really deserved it. this movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture and the third to win 11 oscars. this movie has brilliant effects acting and anything else you can want from a film. the hobbits acted way better than the second one this did have and ending and it was the best of the saga. it is all i can say and let me rephrase it i am a strict critic and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. it is totally over-the-top recommended.this movie was the best in the series simply because of heath ledgers rip fabulous performance. his portrayal of the evil mastermind joker was simply faultless. the other actors were good as well. even though in batman 3 batman met a more powerful foe in bane in this movie he met a villain with a brilliant mind in joker. also harvey dents transformation in two-face was nice he kept his coin tossing thing which i like in particular about him. he used his mind to catch criminals but from now on he will use his brain to be a great foe for our hero batman. i strongly recommend this movie for those who like this genre of movies inspired by comic books.this movie was simply fantastic. action packed suspenseful and yet still enchanting. acting in the movie is terrific especially from mckellen and mortenson. peter jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece completely deserving the best picture oscar. the plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded fellowship of the ring in their quest to destroy the powerful one ring. frodo baggins sam gamgee and their guide gollum are on a quest to the cracks of doom while the rest of the fellowship is preparing for war with sauron forger of the one ring and his soldiers. it this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. the cgi is breathtaking especially for 2003. everything in the movie looks lifelike. the cinematography in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of ones feet. battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed intense and high-octane. i know i dont seem too exited about this movie but this movie is terrific. if you havent seen this movie see it. it is a classic and one of the best films out there.this movie was released when i was all of 9 years old. lucky for me i didnt come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. i have always been a movie buff and aside from that a big fan of the writings of stephen king. i had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film which i was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. afterwards i had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema. first and foremost was the story itself. the writing of this tale in screenplay form is absolutely brilliant. the story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. from the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice as our main character is judged by his peers to the dawning realization of what shawshank penitentiary has to offer for its masses of convicted felons. it all flows fabulously as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope andy and red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. its this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of the shawshank redemptions impact. second but just as vital was the casting. tim robbins has always been in my mind a criminally underrated acting talent. he always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength and in that conflict one always questions his motivation his reason for doing things. his skill set was married perfectly to the character of andy dufrense who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. indeed its safe to say that mentally at least andy spent very little time in that prison. morgan freeman played the role of red redding in a manner that i think no other actor could have done. he was not only a veteran of shawshank he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to freemans on-stage abilities. as a man who can get things red is instrumental in many inmates lives in shawshank. offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples cigarettes petty cash red is as important a character as andy in terms of the films overall message of hope despite hopelessness. and morgan freeman was the best man for that job. the excellent acting doesnt end there. bob gunton who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types portrays the warden of shawshank as a sinister scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the bible and an arrogant holier-than-thou attitude. william sadler is another outstanding character actor similar to gunton whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as heywood. one of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden guard officer hadley who was portrayed by clancy brown well known for his bad-ass-type roles. his no-nonsense hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesnt exist. beyond the writing and the acting this movie was perfect in every other aspect. ive seen it many times over the years often turning to it perhaps subconsciously during particularly rough or depressing patches. ive very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. the shawshank redemption is one of those films where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. a masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of its impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.this movie was really well done 100% through. it is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story but its also an intelligent film. we dont see that too much and i hope to see more films like this it makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. every director wants to tell a great story but few let the story tell itself. this is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget youre watching a movie at all. as a young filmmaker this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. lets just hope studio thoughts dont pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...this movie was one of the best i have seen. the graphics were great. the way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. i loved watching every second of it. the first time i watched it i watched it three times in a row because i couldnt get enough of the movie. the lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. what they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. i absolutely loved this movie. one that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. i think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. they might feel the same way that i do about it. i love itthis movie was honestly a lot different than i had expected i was expecting more evil on maleficents part however there was more depth in her character and i think the movie did a great job expressing her character in a more complex way it was definitely a lot sadder than i had expected i cant get over how great angelina jolie was as the part of maleficent her expressions were extremely detailed and i was very impressed with her acting i think this movie is a definite yes and i will be back in theaters to watch it again it was a beautiful film and i think many will find that it is much more enjoyable than they had expected i will definitely be recommending this movie to othersthis movie was great definitely a five star movie four star at the lowest tom cruise acted really well it was exciting and they didnt make it all killing death etc this movie was exciting as it sounded so there was no ripoff however i do think they could have created less talking and more doing so it would be very fun and not exactly like the real thing in life after all it is fictional stuff its no real its not based on a true story but besides that this movie was good this movie has very little cuss words which makes it more easier for more parents to saying yes to their kids on watching this awesome movie this is a movie for the young and old who love action like this i personally can not wait to get this on dvd and i can not wait to see its sequels mi2 mi3 and mission impossible ghost protocol you will want to do all the same enjoy this great movie that will always be a great spy classic for yearsthis movie was excellence at its best. in my mind it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end. thats what this one did to me. besides the point that the acting was some of the best youll see in the 90s. the story was golden. if you havent seen this get it now.this movie was an incredibly blend of everything that makes movies interesting and fun from completely three dimensional characters to witty dialogue to outrageously funny situations quentin tarantino has molded years of pulp noir into something truly his ownthis movie was amazing peter jackson has a true vision and this entire trilogy was wonderful. tolkien would be extremely proud. the only thing that bums me out now is the fact that there arent any more to look forward to next year... how about making the hobbit  its a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant and provides satisfying closure all around. many liberties are taken from the original novels but for the big screen it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. themes of war corruption addiction good and evil and adventure all prevail. as before this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. all the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles especially viggo mortensen who stands out more in this film than before but it is always a pleasure to watch ian mckellen as gandalf along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies. writing is superb. this production boasts some excellent sets props and costumes. special effects are huge  at its time it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. despite aging a bit the effects are still impressive. howard shores music  is as masterful as ever. return of the king delivers the best possible payoff for the lord of the rings trilogy and it might even outshine the hobbit saga in the end. not only does it boast some of the biggest battles but it is also a film with power and beauty. it has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites was my number-one favorite for quite a few years and the lord of the rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle storytelling and style. if you watch the extended edition of this film you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes which offers a lot of excellent substance. among the additions there are longer battle scenes a scene showing the fate of saruman and wormtongue an extended encounter with the army of the dead a parley with the mouth of sauron and more. i think most of these scenes are really awesome and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing. 5/5 experience: perfect | story: perfect | film: perfectthis movie tops off what i as a fantasy lover have always dreamed of seeing. a world class true fantasy movie. this has to be one of the best movies i have seen in recent memory. the plot story line and peter jacksons vision were amazing. again if you want to see a movie with heart passion determination soul. then this is one that i would recommend a++this movie rock. best super hero movie of all times maybe. the joker stole the entire show. hes like a savage tornado on gotham city and only batman can stop him. the joker is not the only bad ass in town. two face is also here to make the life of batman a living hell. this film is not only an action movie but also a psychological drama. never in a batman movie a director explore so deep the mind of a super hero. christopher nolan make a wonderful job. the choice of heath ledger was a little bit critical but his performance shut all the critic up. and aaron eckart is the best two face ever. ok its not tough to top the performance of the other but.this movie represents the result of a hard working and amazing director peter jackson as well as amazing and emotive performances and the whole look is beyond epic. i love this film for its moral values there is nothing offensive in this movie which is refreshing and rare. an amazing conclusion to the best trilogy ever. expect amazing battle sequences great acting great cgi amazing moral values and messages just a perfect film. this is more than a movie it is an experience and rightly deserved the 11 oscars it proudly won. peter jackson really understands what the whole concept of lord of the rings is about he managed to capture the purity of frodo and sams friendship the epic nature of the big scale action sequences and i respect the script writing team philipa fran peter for creating the emotion which is filled in the film. this is a brilliant film which will last for generations :dthis movie really gorges with characters view angle and the normal from point a to point b is replaced with fickle sense of time  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece pulp is cult this movie really deserves to be #1 in the top 250. its just so cheerful. if you havent seen it yet first read the book or the whole trilogy then you will understand the movie. yes so i am not gonna tell you any spoilers. but if you read the book or saw the movie congratulations you understood the book and the movie at the same time. if you live in new zealand everyone and you really loves the movie and the book and that is why new zealand is famous because of the lord of the rings. the movie has great roles and characters like frodo baggins gollum sam gandalf the grey. and the movie is declared one of the best movies ever in numerous countries. and that was my review of the lord of the rings: the return of the king.  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog. what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about. like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends. if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence this movie proves its worth of having top spot on imdb list.it is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.great acting displayed by lead actors specially morgan freeman.truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.dialouges of this film are well written. you will miss something if have not watch it. highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.i will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.like godfather.godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.this movie not so yang but still great you were terrified by actor in this story i think it is best movie from 90-x director is very creative person what stile we can call tarantino stile actors and play is great when i was watching this movie i feel atmosphere this story sone time i watch again this movie because i like this story and stile this movie you can split your live for to part: before watch this movie and after i like watch this movie which my friend you can start watching from any part that is ok tarantino is going to great master if he create only this movie it like icon cinema i havent watch movie lake this i mean so creative and unusually i recommended this movie for watchingthis movie is without a doubt one of the if not the greatest achievement in the history of filmmaking .it is not just the best movie i have seen in my entire life but my best cinematic experience.peter jackson has changed the history of cinema with the amazing magnificent epic saga lord of the rings.the return of the king is a great conclusion to this breathtaking saga and is far way better then the first two episodes.guys i do not recommend you to see this series you must see it. if you want to see a movie than see this movie .i am serious i have seen it 20 times without exaggerating and if you don t like it than you know nothing about movies.the movie has won 11 oscars and the whole saga 14 .the scenario is excellent the screenplay is superb the filming is perfect the costumes are magnificent the music is majestic.if i had too say one more thing it would be :go see this movie -. this movie is unpredictableif you avoid the many movie clips that is it is heartwarming yes it has action yes they also mixed in a lot of comedy and adventure it has a little romancevery little it is well written with great special effects and so it is really easy to recommend to the pg13 movie crowd i intend to buy it the second it comes out marvel and disney are going to make a ton of money on this excellent film it is the best of all the marvel films they have done i state that not owning one comic book or reading anything at all about this characters i hope they start working on the sequel as soon as possibleand that they keep the same writers and the same directorthis movie is undoubtedly one of the best of the decade its like no country for old men lord of the rings gladiator the departed there will be blood and the dark knight all of them considered the best of the 2000s its the first of its kind and it doesnt turn out to be a money grab but instead a must see because it takes place over 12 years the acting changes and so does writing directing and the overall environment simply it matures if this isnt up there for best pic at the oscars someone will have to answer for there crimes ps not a family movie more details in parents guidethis movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring and then the lord of the rings: the two towers and ended with the lord of the rings: the return of the king which is what i am writing about now and i believe it was the best out of the three. it was intriguing and mysterious which is what i enjoy when watching a movie. it goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you dont get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. if you enjoyed this trilogy of the lord of the rings then i highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the hobbits.this movie is the most amazing in the industrys history . the best in the way it shows sequence of the events . morgan freeman played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger  peace  mystery  hate  love  betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... view and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... the imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movies main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls but in some scenes .... its a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....this movie is the best of everything the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. you have to love the pros as well as the antags. this movie as one reviewer once said of this movie it is the best movie of this generation the saddest part it is the last movie. the only thing i have to say that was a downer it needed more epic battles so my top 5 have now changed: 5=scarface4=matrix3=lord of the rings 32=godfather1=citizen kane.this movie is the best movie in batman trilogy.its a wonderful acting by christian bale and heath ledger.according to me heath ledger was the most appropriate for the role of joker.but it is very sad to tell that heath ledger is no more among us. movie is full of thrill and bruce wayne with many more gadgets.bale as usual has given us an another wonderful movie.the best part of the movie is that it keeps you enrolled. bales seriousnessmichael caines advisesmorgan freemans humor and jokers dialogues keeps you free of boredom. this is must watch for bales and waynes fans. this movie is not just 1 time watch and whoever do not love batman i would surely ensure that after watching this movie they would forget that they once hated batman. on the whole this movie is just awesomethis movie is so famous believable and intriging that many rumors are circulated about it as if it were more than just a movie which is basically all that it is pulp fiction is a perfect example of how effective a good film can be while becoming a part of american culture its one of those times when you want to seek the director and badger him with questions only to not recieve answers because shallowing a deep masterpiece would only take away the magic pulp fiction is not an exercize in creating thick plots but one in creating believable charasmatic characters all they do is talk simply because theyre cool funny charming fictional people whom we love to see talking the movies primary way of entertaining us is by showing us how each person talks uniquely and like every great film it relies heavily on performance its one of my top ten and i give it a ***10****this movie is simply the best superb script directing and acting this movie cant really be compared with any other movies since its so different the story line jumps around and youll see scenes from other perspectives later in the film there is no start there is no ending but its a very good movie ether youll hate this movie or youll love it you will probably love i did and a whole generation with methis movie is quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever written and produced tarantino is a brilliant storyteller and one of the best in the business reservoir dogs exposed us to qt but pulp fiction made him a godthis movie is probably one of the greatest movies in the 21st century everything about it just spell genius all the charactersthe performancethe directingthe storyline and the actionbut contrary to what people may thinkheath ledgers joker wasnt the best thing in the movie all the actors deserved oscar nominations because the acting they did was marvelousor dcious see what i did thereanywaychris nolan just max out in genius and visionary and innovationits an amazing masterpiece that doesnt have a single flawa lot of the movies lately just gives you a choice quality or fun which is the case with marveland dc movies these days the mcu just gives full throttle awesomness and fun while the dccu tries hardly to have quality by making its movies serious and sad but fails horriblyyesman of steelim talking about youat least marvel successfully delivers fun and mind blowing action scenesbut this movie doesnt give you a choice it delivers: funawesomenessseriousnessqualitymeaningactingdirecting cinematography and just a heck of a villaini think the joker was awesomein every way but i think hes a wee bit overrated everything in the movie is mind blowing and deserves more credit as a movie than just one actors great performance. watch the dark knight it changed my life just as it will do to youits the godfather of our timethe stairway to heaven of moviesa complete and utter masterpiece which lacks nothingit may be the best movie of your life it may not but theres one thing for sure you will not be disappointedi think calling it an epic masterpiece is underselling it i think its much more than that its a life changing event in cinema an absolute thriller and magnificent story. its one of the greatest movies of all time.this movie is poetry. for those of you whove ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue youll understand what i mean when i say this. the first thing that makes this movie great is morgan freemans ability to narrate the way he does. his soft yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. he is a natural story teller so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooththis movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. it is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hope. one night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped what would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping well andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. the brilliant morgan freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sure. there are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and i have commented on hundreds of movies but very few i gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.this movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life your life morgan freeman makes us feel the sadness and tim robbins the faith in a dark atmosphere.this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen. it has comedy suspense action everything you could want in a movie. this movie is brilliant it may be the single best movie ever this movie has the best casts assembled ever from samuel l. jackson to john travolta to bruce willis. then how viewers are taken through a journey of 3 stories that all intertwine together. nothing is predictable through the movie like most movies are. quentin tarantino is an directs this movie amazingly. this movie is a all-time classic that you could watch 100 times and never get bored of it. the first time i watched it i watched it about 10 more times right after that because it was so good.this movie is one of the best ive seen if not the best i feel mr jackson should have gotten an oscar nomination for his role as jules forest gumps tom hanks wouldnt have stood a chance  john travoltas performance was good but could not beat samuel l jacksons portrayal of jules the hitman i liked the scenes being presented asynchronously giving the sense of peoples worlds being connected but they the characters not really being aware of the interconnectivity of their lives roles the violence in the movie is not gratuitous hope im using this word correctly  the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene  dialogue excellent  and getting medieval on your ass will forever be with us  also going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a pliers  what i also liked was the realism of the movie  i mean no cops around when you need them  in another movie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here  just pure unadulterated violence this movie is one of the best i have ever seen. i first read the book and i didnt liked it that much but then i saw the movie. and thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book. its the other way normally. but in this case the movie is so much better i like the end more than in the book. watch the movie it is great.  but if you pay attention you shall see what he mean. in fact all the hole charm of tarantino is his way of make a good plot showing little details and thats make this unique at all. you can know all the hole life of the character just listening well the dialogs in the movie...and this is fantastic in a strange way. well my last word is: watch this movie is one of my all time favorites. undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. story cast screenplay all are great. the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. it was narrated by morgan freeman who is the best narrator in hollywood i believe. actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. it will change the way u think about things around u. surely it will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope. i can say with confidence this is the best movie i have ever seen - or ever will see. if you havent watch it yet just go watch it now  you couldnt just hold off on the rest of the series if the fellowship of the ring didnt pan out financially. the emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time frodo and sam reach the summit of mt. doom. as with their journey in the story once youve gone this far as a viewer youre incredibly committed to the outcome and what an outcome. bravo. ~steven c thanks for reading visit moviemusereviews.com this movie is not your ordinary hollywood flick. it has a great and deep message. this movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. tim robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. he was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive. his performance just made me smile. robbins plays andy dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. he is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. in he becomes friends with ellis boyd red redding played by morgan freeman. freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike robbins lost hope. he is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. his way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. with his friendship with andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. andy also becomes friends with the rest of reds group. james whitmore also gave a great performance as brooks halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of red he has been institutionalized. the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent. he kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. he portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance. whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. it has everything you could possibly want.this movie is more than just a movie this is about freedom and peace between each other many people will learn something watching it about how the mind could be free when your body is not... thatîäs all i have to say about the greatest movie of all times thanks if you have read my comments d@vethis movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic: this movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic: this movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic:this movie is just the pinnacle of movie-making from the bizarre yet believable situations to the dialogs between characters there is probably no other movie where i enjoy myself more the story is non- linear but the thing is is that it doesnt bother the viewer at all the legendary opening the legendary ending the quotes the soundtrack the performances this might just at well be considered the perfect me to me it is i rarely give a movie 10/10 but pulp fiction is the movie that deserves it because there is no possible way you could improve it on a personal note there is something about this movie that truly makes me nostalgic although it is stuffed with violent and nihilistic themes this movie is like a big goodbye to the good times and an in-your-face times will never bee this cool againthis movie is just beyond great. everything about it was pitch perfect. the acting was fantastic especially from ledger and bale . bale and ledger just worked so well together in the scenes that they were in. ledger was the perfect joker. he had the ability to be as dark as the people wanted to see from joker he had the voice the tone and the look of joker. he was able to bring the best out of everyone that he was in a scene with and that is what made him a true highlight of the movie. it will be very hard to find someone that can portray joker quite like him. now on to bale. christian bale was as good of a batman as one can be. not only was he great as batman but also as bruce wayne. bale was the best bruce wayne that i have seen in my time of being a batman fan  which is a very long time . now i know that some might disagree with that but im sticking to my statement. the next reboot of batman will have a lot of pressure to top not just this trilogy but just this movie.this movie is just as great as the three before it. the camera angles lighting and effects were amazing. i am so proud of the actors viggo orlando elijah ian and everyone else without this amazing cast lord of the rings would not feel the way it does. andy serkis props to you for your amazing portrayal of gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. the camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. with all these factors i feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. intense nostalgia grabs me when i watch this film now and i couldnt be more happier.this movie is great it has everything in it. fantastic acting by all actors and actresses. the dark knight is darkgrandiose and mad and hugely entertaining. the screenplay is really awesome from the start to the end i love heath ledger as the joker and christian bale as batman every time those come on screen together it gives me goosebumps. i liked batman begins and dark knigt rises to but this is absolutely a master piece from christopher nolan. nolan totally smashed the trilogy from the 90s. for me this is one of the best movies ever made i hope you all enjoy the movie rip heath ledgerthis movie is excellent why most importantly it is original it can be said quite accurately that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films no one can ever accuse quentin tarantino of not doing his homework repo man or la femme nikita as obvious examples he even rips off much of his own material from reservoir dogs but the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original many people have stated that pulp fiction has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned frankly i dont think imitation proves anything and i dont think pulp fiction was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films however to my mind pulp fiction is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting pulp fiction also has a few truly original moments christopher walkens wonderfully dry delivery of the your father kept this watch in his ass for years story is hilarious there is only one serious flaw in this film: quentin tarantino is a very poor actor thank god he confined himself to a small role if he really feels the need to be onscreen he should just go ahead and pull a hitchcockian cameo in his films sure its derivative but at least his screen presence will be minimizedthis movie is excellent and it has some great special effects the acting was also good i got sucked into the movie right from the start thats what i call moviemagic theres not many movies or producers can do this so big shoutout to christopher nolan i saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original i havent seen any movie like this before the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect the question many people ask how will the earth and the humans be in 100 yearsor longer and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years i also like the more than 3 dimensional talk in it all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch this movie gets 1010 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them tear scenes and joy scenes it brings you so far into the movie and its great written by johnthis movie is epic. it takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. all the characters are well embedded the drama of each is well explored. viggo mortensen is the perfect aragon. better than fellowship of the ring. better than the the two towers tolkin rest in peace. because your job of your life was not thrown in the trash peter  you are the guy... this movie is epic. it takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. all the characters are well embedded the drama of each is well explored. viggo

of the year  perhaps of the decadei think it probably impacted me more than othersbecause i have a similar age that the actor haveso it was kind of nostalgic in some situations i could see the changes that the actors were having in a subtle way and that was just very naturalits very interesting you see a 10 years old boy playing video games and in just some minutes the same boy looking for a job or looking for relationshipsit shows in a brilliant way how time its easily gonei dont really think it is possible to do a spoiler with this movie  but if its possible  perhaps the following paragraph may contain the end is fantasticin the very moment the movie is over  you thinkyou feel the moment present moment and you just know that life is built of little moments  and this movie was certainly one of minethis movie is by far the best out of the batman trilogy. i think the joker made the movie with his new darker and scarier theme. dont get me wrong christian bale also did an amazing job but heath ledger made it. it is very sad that heath has passed but this movie will go on in history and i dont know about everyone else but i find this movie one of heath ledgers best movies i have seen. just the fact that he did an amazing job playing the joker and brought the character to life. i think thats what made it so amazing. if heath were still here i think we all wouldve liked to see where his career wouldve went after this role.this movie is based on a novella by stephen king but dont let that put you off. its not a horror film rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since the crying game. found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion sullen accountant andy dufresne robbins casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the shawshank state prison for life. it is here the movie gracefully unfolds. with a beautifully rounded script writer/director darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. dufresne all the while protesting his innocence slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. among them is red freeman in a matchless supporting role the lifer who can given time provide virtually anything. and for reasons best known to himself dufresne requires 40s starlet rita hayworth provisioned in poster form. the mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy shawshank catacomb. then it gets really mean gearing up for its injury-time shockers. dufresne a whiz with figures is bullied into running the wardens gunton petty accounting scams giving him the chance to execute his and the films final greatest miracle. if youre miserable enough to look for gripes then yes it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again yet the ending has such poetic completeness youre too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. this may have confounded american audiences - it flopped big-time on planet yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of oscardom. spread the word.this movie is an instant classic. everything about it is perfect - the acting the special effects the plot the music and the complete and utter emotion it contains. it will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. i have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies and this one will always be my favorite. this is the movie i will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. i have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. i hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as i have and will. kudos peter jackson. continue to amaze and inspire us with your work.this movie is a total proof that christopher nolan is actually a very forward director he claims the batman franchise with a very unique and dark film about the most prolific hero of dc. and its not just about the direction of nolan what makes this movie one of the best of all the times there are the stunning casting. heath ledger show us with that clever performance how to reinvent a character as the joker which is one of the best villains ever made and he just add another element and history to him. also christian bale performance is a highlight for me is the best batman of all just because of the darkness in the voice and the capacity to show us the two parts of bruce wayne. im not surprised that this film is in top 10 of the best films ever made because it captures all the single parts of an amazing film.this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. as with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. this film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. and while every member of the fellowship has their part to play i finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about sam. its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. sean astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. as as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. jackson ended this film the way it should have been. this is probably the best movie ever made. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it. excellent 10/10.this movie is a masterpiece on every level all the references to mcdonalds the cereal that was discontinued which quentin has saved and put into the movie it is all a piece of american culture and coming from a guy from europe i simply love all that brand stuff following criminals in their daily lives hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit it is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions the acting well i think john travolta was bad even tho he got critical acclaim but samuel give the performance of his life the drugs i like that this movie didnt focus on sex it feels so cheap instead it depicts a housewifes cocaine use classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin it is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy it didnt feel like a cheap trick it is morbid humor appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers as well as for respected criticsthis movie im not going to call this film the imdb #1 movie but i really cant deny that this is fantastic. the cast the  the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength. its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. it is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope. a hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. we see these people as years of time goes by. we see friendships grow and topics change. it really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars. you feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all. 4 stars out of 4this movie hit it right out of the ball park for me reading all of these negative and cynical reviews has me stumped i thought this film was way better than i expected it to be even my dad who is quite a tough movie critic thoroughly enjoyed it although everyone is entitled to their opinion to me this movie is one i could watch over and over again and i highly recommend it its perfectly written and the acting is right up there along side the amazing script the movie flows together youre never wondering whats going on or have to worry about getting confused because its so detailed and thorough

many of its viewers david fincher is someone ive come to admire as a filmmaker with his movies like se7en and social network so i obviously was interested in seeing this especially after watching the first trailer fincher and his marketing campaign made a smart move in not showing any big plot points in the trailers yet managed to keep you intrigued not something you see a lot of these days in movie trailers since this is a spoiler free review i wont go into too much of the details but this is probably the best performance ive seen from rosamund pike and the same for ben affleck i first noticed pike in movies like jack reacher and the worlds end and now i have a lot more respect for her as an actress ben affleck ive always liked as an actor before even in his directorial efforts and this id say is one of his best performances tyler perry who ive felt indifferent towards really impressed me here as the lawyer who helps ben afflecks character face the accusations against him neil patrick harris on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable in the wrong way nothing against the guy though but i dont think he was the right choice for the character he played gone girl does an excellent job of showing you how a persons life can crumble to the ground based on a few lies the media throws around just to bump up the viewership ratings and how a lot of us tend to believe everything that comes out a reporters mouth without considering that theyre might be more underneath the surface than what theyre showing you it also stands as a harsh and cynical commentary on marriage and how it falls apart based on how you treat your spouse and without giving anything away the marriage portrayal in this film makes me never want to get married or have a relationship put this in the hands of a lesser filmmaker gone girl wouldnt be getting the response its gotten its pretty clear that fincher is sitting behind the camera with his bleak tone dark color palette and how pessimistic everyone feels about life in general combine finchers direction with the screenplay by gillian flynn the author of the book of the same name there are so many twists and turns that suck you right in trying to figure out what happens next and has one of the most shocking scenes thatll blow your mind gone girl is a film that people will remember for a long time myself included and im willing to call it one of the best of 2014 i look forward to whatever david fincher does in the futurethis movie has some of the best dialogue i have heard in movies even though it doesnt have a lot of action this movie kept me hooked because of the interaction between the characters for example the entire scene where they are trying to clean marvin out of the car harvey keitel interacting with samuel l jackson and john travolta with a cameo from quentin tarantino this scene was one of my favorite from any movie another scene that i really enjoyed was the gimp scene with bruce willis and marcellus wallace dont know the actors name the only scene that i dont really like is the one with bruce willis and his girlfriend in their apartment even though it has some great dialogue i didnt really care for their relationship but this movie has some of the best comedy scenes and tense scenes like the final standoff as wellthis movie has many stories to tell. every scene has its own story. i like the way morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. the scene where andy gets beer for his coworkers. also when he plays the two italian singers on prison radio. brooks last few days.and how red comes to terms with his freedom. i recently watched it for the first time and cant believe how i could miss this for so long. i also cant believe morgan never won oscar for this. i cant think of any better performance than this.truly deserves the number one spot. since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. thank you frank darabont for giving us hope.this movie has is all.. good actors good story and a helluva speed all through the movie.. you will never be bored when watching this movie.. with so many good actors in one movie you could think that it would not be a good movie. but in my opinion this is the best movie john travolta & laurent fishbourne ever acted in.. they both are in their peak performance.. one very cool thing about this movie is that you may think that you know whats gonna happened next... but believe me you dont have a clue... i have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. and i could easily watch it 50 times more without getting bored.. it deserves a big 10/10.. if you havent seen it go get a copy immediately..this movie has got to be one of the craziest films ever made. including the all-star cast & the different story lines how it all comes together in the end so to speak is brilliant. first time i seen this i didnt know what i was in for but glad i did. tarantino at his original best is still around the time this film was made. 5 stars qt this is by far one of his best works now lets just hope that mr. willis doesnt want to do a 2nd part to this ... that would be just scary. dont know hoe wed be able to handle a all new version remake or sequel: zeds dead baby ... wait no hes back as a zombie :-this movie has everything the final chapter of a trilogy needs it is absolutely amazing in every single aspect that i am finding it tough to even find one fault in it. the acting was astonishing right down to the all the bad ugly looking creaturesabsolutely amazing special effects and peter jackson deserves one big round of applause for this filming masterpiece. in this movie frodo and samastin and wood did amazing jobs considering to their roles and kept their friendship going and merry and pippin also played their roles amazingly well when they were handed bigger roles in this third and final installment of the trilogy.bloomdavies reprised their roles exceedingly well and there is no movie at all without aragornviggo mortensen.he did everything possible needed of him and he met each and every one of those expectations great job done their. ian mckellen also does a very good job and there was no movie if it was not for the special effects the battles were astonishing in this movies which makes me want to keep watching the movie over and over again. all said and done this is the finishing touch to an absolute masterpiece and the final block of the puzzle to the lord of the rings trilogy.the acting was made to perfection and if i was given the chance i will praise this movie over and over again together with the previous two movies. this movie provides entertainment to every person around and it deserves the credit it gets. overall i will give this movie a 10/10. an unforgettable masterpiece in my opinion.this movie has everything great actors fun action and awesome dialogue. the only thing this movie is missing is a theme which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. you dont have to think too much about it it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. the first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was whatttt the second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. i really cant explain why i like the movie so much it just sort of stuck with me. john travolta and sam jackson are incredible they show what hit men talk about when they arent killing people. uma thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit mens bosss wife. simply put this movie is incredible but it may take you two viewings. ten stars from me.  pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film. this movie has a great plot and good acting the characters are fantastic and the action sequences are impressive. subtle plot points may be missed easily so you have to watch the movie again to get the full plot. however realism is another storythis movie guardians of the galaxy is a marvel movie about 5 space criminals who works together in order to stop ronan the accuser in destroying the entire galaxy these comics were only known by few people it became famous when the actors were announced to play each of their characters it became more famous when the trailer and the movie was released the movie was liked by everyone and this movie is very excellent you will enjoy this movie for sure unlike other marvel movies there were jump scenes unlike here there wasnt any and this movie is also a funny movie and even the after end credit scenes dont miss all the fun in guardians of the galaxythis movie doesnt deserve a 10 it deserves a 11... this is the best movie i ever saw everything on the movie is great the story the acting the message just everything. i spoke with so many people that saw this movie and everyone of them said that the shawshak redemption is a truly masterpiece. if someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you havent yet because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. it is the best rated movie 9.2 and when i see that rating im just asking myself why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10this movie despite the fact that i have now seen it more than 20 times never gets old and certainly never fails to impress the actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of the scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it but i assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you this movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyones mind this is my opinion on the film it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge quentin tarantino fan but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend itthis movie defines excellence in the field of comic book heroes and in the field of cinema. its a crime that this film wasnt nominated for best picture because it clearly was the best film of the decade. no other comic book hero will ever surpass this film because you cant beat perfection and this movie is perfection. i can say that i have seen the dark knight at least twenty times and my life and yes at times it gets boring but i keep watching because i love watching perfect films. if i see this movie come on television i always record or watch it. i wont skip out on that. it will be hard to make another batman story with the fact that christopher nolan has changed comic book movies forever with this one filmthis movie completes the series perfectly jackson is a genius. this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. i only hope they make a remake that is even better than this movie if thats possible. all those haters who say that this movie is boring then they are missing the point and i would love to see what movies they find interesting. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it hands down. overall = amazing 10/10this movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place it is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have its about friendship its about dedication and determination it teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. i rated this movie 10/10 because i seriously couldnt find any flaw the direction script acting production values and acting. what i like about this movie is thats all about humans its about the simple human needs that we seek freedom love respect power friendship health fairness and justice. this movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference it will touch you so deepthis movie can be put into so many words but heres just one...excellent. once again christopher nolan teams up with the wonderful christian bale with also some other new characters like the joker which is definitely the best villain i have ever witnessed in my life. heath ledger1978-2008 gives his best performance ever in this movie totally oscar worthy. harvey dent which is played wonderfully by aaron eckhart especially when he becomes two-face. and then we have maggie gyllenhaal who gives a terrific performance as bruce waynes love rachel dawes. please do go see this film you will be very glad you did.this movie by far is the best cult fiction movie ever made streamlined performance of samuel l jackson makes it a wonderful dark thriller of ages by far known as the era of amateur crime becoming professional in a way a must watch in any movies list before you die epic thriller of all time and the twists in plots with an ultimate climax takes the movie into the very next level a true entertainer of sorts with a great impact on the box office in those time it is one of the highly rated movies of all time and a well directed acted produced combination the in depth realisation of each character is another strong point of this film with major emphasis given on the lead actors the movie takes a good support from the female actors who helps in the building up of the story the supporting role are well organised and created intellectually the contribution from each department of the movie is prominent and locations of shooting and storyline settings are well taken care about the movie has won much appreciations and great audience support and is still a celebrated movie worldwide the movie can be guided into the record books as the very literature of film makingthis movie brings back lots of great memories so im biased anyway... nevertheless a lot of people feel the same way about this piece. im sure of that. the return of the king sums the trilogy up more than nicely. so well done. with lots of blood sweat and tears put into it. you feel it by watching it. lesnies cinematography is a perfect fit for the epic landscapes and the breathtaking visual effects. i have to mention that i never read the book but from a movie standpoint the story works just fine for me. and even to i may have overseen some goofs here and there it all makes sense in the end. for those that havent had the pleasure to watch it in cinemasi recommend getting the extended version dvd the one with all three movies included. the included making of is one of the best made behind the scenes looks out there.this movie blew me away one word to some it all up is refreshing thats what this movie was to me finally something different original but intelligent the way the story is told the dialogue the cast  everything was right on the money the movie is filed with classic scenes memorable quotes and unforgettable characters i recommend this film to everyone who wants to see something fresh beware you must open minded fallow the story but dont worry even if its told in a special way it isnt avant-garde to the point where its impossible to understand it i just hope that tarantino can come up with the magic again i was disappointed with jackie brown i cannot blame him not every movie could be masterpiecethis movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. i had been worried about seeing it because of how much peter jackson re-wrote two towers and presented scenes that undermined some of tolkiens fundamental ideas. this time jackson followed tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. its a real shame we didnt get to see christopher lee in this movethis movie and indeed all the lord of the rings movies is the best that i have ever seen. in fact i wouldnt consider this a movie because generally when i watch a movie its just entertainment for me not something to be remembered and thought of long after ive watched it. this masterpiece of film-making this beautiful moving incredible conclusion to a trilogy which held me in amazement from the battle at the plains of gorgoroth to the ringbearers passing at the grey havens is perhaps the best adaptation of a book ever. if you are perhaps reading this comment having not seen the movies buy them and watch them now. the best way to watch them is not one after another quickly without time to reflect on each one but one evening after another with time to appreciate and understand tolkiens masterpiece. ive seen the comments on this movie few as they are which nearly all say that they loved the books and hated the movies giving various reasons as to why. ill give you a few examples. 1. the characters werent developed at all. im sorry the actors and actresses from the movies were all incredible doing what they were best at amazingly well. ian mckellen the actor who played gandalf does one of perhaps the best performances ive ever seen. elijah wood as frodo understands the effect the ring has on the hobbit and shows that knowledge to create a moving performance of an individual struggling against a power that is too great to bear. i could go on but its not necessary. every single character in that film is as well developed as anyone would be in real life. 2. the scouring of the shire was not shown. i can give a completely logical explanation for this. in the book near to the end of rotk frodo and sam destroy the ring and sauron and all evil is defeated. the hobbits weary of all their adventures and sorrows return home to find that saruman and wormtongue have taken over the shire and are forced to defeat them as well. now to me and most other people that have read the books this is seen as a huge anticlimax. think about it in movie form. the audience having watched an amazing three hours of film are now ready for the end. then suddenly saruman pops out of nowhere and has almost ruined the shire. in the books this is acceptable because it shows that evil can come to the most good of places. but this has already been shown many times in other parts of the book like lothlorien fangorn and ithilien to some extent. 3. too much cgi. i can answer this criticism fairly quickly. imagine if there was little or no cgi in the lord of the rings movies. all it would be would be close up shots of the actors and places with maybe a few actors in prosthetic makeup. this would never give the sense of scale necessary for the books. for the places and things tolkien describes you need cgi and i cannot see how anyone could possibly criticise that. 4. not true to the books so what any movie that you see that is based on a book is never and i repeat never completely and utterly true to the book. peter jackson took these masterpieces of literature and turned them into masterpieces of film-making and people who say they werent true to the books are sometimes right but the films must be seen as works of art in their own right. actually the love story between aragorn and arwen is used in the movies and fitted in perfectly with the rest whereas tolkien put this in the appendices. there arent other any major criticisms that i can find apart from petty things like they sucked and i walked out 30 minutes before the end. these comments are not worthy of argument mainly because they are made by people that probably have never seen the sun. sorry about that but it had to be said. still there are just some people who dont like fantasy and dont like these films. fine i can respect that. but really these films arent just fantasy. theyre a story that has enchanted generations a tale of war peace beauty good evil friendship hope fear and love that would work in any genre. i challenge any film-maker to surpass these films ever again and im sure that in fifty years these films will still be popular with people watching them in goggles in 3d blu-ray. just speculating anyway for me these films are incredible. nothing more to be said.this isnt just a fancy superhero movie...its beyond that. it deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellence. christopher nolan is as usual at his best. nolan strikes with his non- linear storytelling in his own style. we will be blown with his sublime work. this is definitely the sequel we deserved. christian bale and heath ledger were phenomenal. the joker has made evil look so good... this is the first film i know where the joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film.this is without doubt my favourite film the acting casting soundtrack story and direction are in my opinion second to none it is violent and thats not why i enjoyed it so much although i can see why some would not like the film because of the excess of the violence but it is funny moving and had me on the edge of my seat throughout youve got to see it at least once maybe not as much as i have watched it possibly or you are missing outthis is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. i think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didnt have such great competition that year it might have won for best picture. this film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of its own apart from the cast  cinematography etc. all of which are deservedly great. this is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing and stop and watch the rest of it no matter what part of the movie you are at. perhaps the godfather and jaws are a couple of others that do that for me and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. one thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director frank darabont. unfortunately he has never come close to achieving the greatness of shawshank with his subsequent films. i thought the green mile was good but it didnt hold a candle to shawshank. i was also very disappointed in the mist. i sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of shawshank redemption in a future film because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.this is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time ill never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine afterward we couldnt stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other we finally decided that we just had to see it again so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct the story is nothing less than superb every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot this is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story the characters are all excellent as well although i was sad to see jack harmen emilio estevez get killed off so quickly i liked his character the cast is extraordinary tom cruise plays ethan hunt perfectly jon voight was the perfect choice for jim phelps emmanuelle beart was very good in her role henry czerny was superb as kittridge jean reno was an excellent addition to the cast ving rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film kristin scott thomas was lovely as always although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things vanessa redgrave was another nice addition to the cast and finally emilio estevez as i mentioned above played a small role and played it quite well i can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldnt like this film due to certain plot points that i cant give away so if you are a big fan of the show be forewarned you may have some issues with the film personally ive never seen a single episode of the old television show so i had absolutely no frame of reference which i believe put me in a better position to appreciate the story i feel that i have to mention the action scenes in this film spectacular the scene where kittridge and hunt are talking in the restaurantjust awesome the entire last 20 minutes of the filmunbelievable the filming the action the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching but luckily there is so much more to appreciate if you are a fan of tom cruise or just crimemysteryaction films in general be sure to check this one out at least twice this is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time i truly hope that you will enjoy this film thanks for reading christhis is without a doubt my favorite movie. every time i see this movie i feel touched by its magic. most of my friends have seen it because i have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it. robbins freeman and whitmores characters are the ones that i like the most. it is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at the oscars nor the golden globes. the imbd voters have it at #2. my hope is to see it in the future at #1.this is what im always looking for in a movie amazing and thoughtprovoking script finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and cgi inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack hans zimmer that connects viewers with the story adding tension passion soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music unlike many science fiction movies interstellar goes the extra light year to bring home the themes of family loss unfathomable exploration and dimensions beyond our scope of reality leave everything at home and experience this tremendous work of art hell make it a holiday present to yourself and everyone you know i know there are a lot of excellent movies that will be released between now and the end of the year but this is an absolute must seethis is truly a masterpiece this is a movie based off a comic book but never was you felt like you are reading a comic book. the movie is so grounded in reality that make you feel like you are in this living world where batman himself can save you. there are many thing that make this movie great. batman he is a crime-fighting hero like any hero he is selfless. he endure pain for other people. he lives by day as a playboy but by night he swing justice to everyone. he is smart skillful selfless and terrifying. he is the dark knight. harvey dent he is a lawyer like any lawyer he bring justice to gotham. but deferent from batman he dont where mask he already fighting justice. he is smart talented charming and brave. he is the gotham white knight. the joker he is the villain of the story like any villain he bring chaos to the table. he break people and bring fear to them just like batman. he evil smart terrifying and manipulative. these three unique character bring different aspect to the movie. all three can not live without the other and all three are in constant conflict. batman need of harvey to be the face gotham deserve harvey need of batman to help him with his work the joker need both of them to make a point. this create a thicken plot packed with action crime drama make for a thrilling experience. this is the movie where people would look back 10-20 years from now and say its a classic. i could spend my hole week watching this movie and i can still find somethings new. if you have not seen this movie give it a shot you will now regret it.this is the second best scifi movie i have watched the first one i absolutely fell in love was the avatar oh i do love those movies the guardians of the galaxy has everything action drama humor it is simply worth watching the storyline is very interesting it is indeed great to watch the creation of someone who has put it on the screen i admire the way the actors play simply amazing i honestly was surprised that vin diesel was the voice of groot and actually after behind the scenes videos i discovered that lee pace is actually ronan amazing how sometimes you cannot even recognize some wonderful personalities really those who havent managed to see it  you must watch enjoy the moviethis is the only movie i would give 10 out of 10 for. this movie has got everything a movie needs: great acting and great actors an amazing storyline superb music a perfect movie length and a fantastic ending. this movie deserves all the credit it gets. it is my favourite movie of all time and always will be. this movie has changed my life.  while it doesnt have the innocence of reservoir dogs or the maneuverability of the kill bill series it definitely stands on its own. it is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the generation x stoner flicks. let me just say that if i could give this movie beyonder points id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. great great work. this is the greatest movie of all time. from the dialog to the story. has some of the greatest characters and some of the most emotional moments. has one of the greatest and most underrated soundtracks ever. there is a big reason this movie won 11 oscarsshould of won 12 for sean astins incredible performance and it should have been nominated for another for andy serkiss smeagol outstanding performance in the beginning scene of the return of the king. it has the best writing of all time and is just such an amazing movie. never gets old i have seen the movie 5 times just in the past year. peter jackson is a genius and j.r.r tolkien is a god. the characters are so amazing. aragorn: the most humble character who led an army to victory and helped middle earth be saved. his battle speech is one of my favorite speeches of all time and his line for frodo was epic. in the ending of the return of the king when he said to the hobbits you bow to no one was just so powerful and amazing. he is one of my favorite characters in this film for sure. gollum/smeagol: corrupted by the power of the ring and cant control it is amazing and his two separate personalities are different. that one scene in the very beginning of the return of the king was just awesome. when he kills his friend deagol for the ring. gandalf: one of the greatest characters ever. so amazing how he pretty much saved the whole of middle earth. you shall not pass was epic and how he came back to life to finish off his mission was amazing. merry/pippin: the lovable funny twins brought entertainment every time they were on screen. merrys stupidity is hilarious. how courageous such a small person can be was amazing samwise: my favorite character in any movie or bookother than severus snape. the greatest friend anyone can ever have. his amazing speech in two towers touched everyone. he should have won an oscar or at least been nominated. he is amazing in the return of the king when he is telling frodo about the shire and his sadness when frodo decides to keep the ring. when he saved frodo from the spider and from the tower in mordor was so epic. he is the friend everyone should have.this is the greatest film ive ever seen. american beauty and north by northwest come pretty close but then again i havent seen citizen kane yet. theres not much i can say about the film that wont give away something so ill just give it my unequivocal endorsement. close the blinds open your mind and watch this film preferably four or five times so everything becomes clearer.this is the great movie that i ever see in the batman movie series. although there are some parts which i never expect before. like at the end the movie indicate a new hero will come to this comic character on the next part. it was really exciting. though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a warner bros. screening last night dark knight ably stands on its own with or without batman begins. at a two and a half hour runtime its definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. a delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of imax footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of gotham city. christian bale plays such a well rounded batman and bruce wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. i still have to remember that bale is british since he speaks with such a spot on american accent. bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for bruce wayne and threateningly for batman. countering him is the late heath ledger who plays such a scary and creepy joker that i found it impossible to not have chills half the time i saw him on screen. what really separates this brand of joker from jack nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. its obvious that to be a good guy and think like the joker it really takes a toll and it sure isnt easy. how exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks initially i was uneasy about how the character of harvey dent would be handled. in my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the batman animated series of the early 90s. as well as tommy lee jones could have handled him in batman forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. aaron eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the batman animated series.this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this movie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u watch it and be inspired thats all i can say it will change the way u think about things around u never let it die in uthis is the first batman movie thats not about batman. its no traditional yarn about a protagonist fighting a villain with audiences hoping the hero beats the bad guy. on the contrary its a thrilling story about the cost of heroism and seduction by evil. tim burton explored anti-hero themes with michelle pfeiffers brooding catwoman in batman returns and although burton failed to flesh it out many people agree catwoman was the best part of that film. director christopher nolan knows better having demonstrated a hitchcockian mastery of psychology with themes of guilt insomnia and competition the prestige. in his film we meet joker a chilling heath ledger a sociopath with a taste for anarchy. he doesnt want revenge or power. in one scene he burns a mountain of cash. the mobsters call him crazy and before he cuts them to pieces he mutters its not about money. its about sending a message. right away we know he isnt a villain we can predict or understand. consequently hes pretty terrifying. ledgers joker is so compelling that he has the best lines and the most memorable scenes. usually we watch superhero films to see how the protagonist overcomes the villain. but in the dark knight we strangely cheer as the joker kicks ass at robbing banks manipulating the mob and even destroying a hospital. strangely enough we walk away from the experience not wanting to be batman. we want to be joker. but thats not what i mean when i say this movie isnt about batman. its actually about da harvey dent aaron eckhart whose strong performance will be overshadowed by ledgers. he is gothams white knight and his tragedy revolves around an anecdote told early in the film about the roman who guards his city not out of power lust but of civic duty-- to which his girlfriend and assistant da rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal wisely refutes dont forget the last man given that duty was named caesar. here lies the central theme-- a man holds power until death or long enough to see himself become the villain. its deep stuff for a batman movie but it works extremely well. many may leave the film wondering why but it has to do with what we missed from star wars episode iii. although were horrified by jokers mind whose villainy rivals anthony hopkins hannibal lecter we cant help but be strangely drawn to his eerie confidence manic charisma and unstoppable power. due to some grueling and unexpected events dent falls from grace and becomes seduced by jokers evil. lets not forget batman who is common-denominator but not centerpiece to the war between dent and joker. dent proclaims batman as gothams hero but others dont agree-- including bruce wayne. wayne is still a jealous self-absorbed and emotionally tortured brat in many ways as we learned from batman begins. he doesnt see himself as a hero. and although he despises dent for stealing rachel away from him he deeply admires him. here we draw the dichotomy of white knight dent and dark knight batman. bruce wayne knows that he cant have rachel unless he gives up batman forever. but theres a pain within him that keeps him out at night fighting his personal demons. he loves rachel the same way dent loves rachel but he wont give up being batman. bruce wayne is not a noble self-sacrificing hero. he has his cake and wants to eat it too. equally dent wants to fight a hard line with crime. hes incorruptible unwilling to compromise doing it for principles of righteousness rather than personal glory. he too refuses to be a hero. but unlike batman he is self-sacrificing fighting in broad daylight in full vulnerability even if it puts him and his loved ones at risk. dont worry-- nolan never lets this character drama drag the story. the movie is wall-to-wall action with sensational stunt sequences that exceed any prior batman film primarily because it uses very few digital effects. its got a gritty organic feel of urban combat like michael manns heat which brought us into a downtown la war-zone where gunshots echo off the walls of buildings. as we witness a chase between an 18-wheeler and a swat truck we know its actually happening. many filmmakers neglect what steven spielberg calls geography and consequent quick-cutting and stylistic shots make the viewer lose their sense of setting. but nolan keeps things very real using helicopter shots and wide-angle lenses the way he did with prior films that depended on atmosphere insomnia the prestige. most people familiar with the comics know that dent becomes the villain two-face. but nolan makes a statement with dents transformation to evil. harvey dent succumbs to crime because his life has endured tragedy and everything hes stood for has fallen to pieces. meanwhile joker isnt so much a villain as a sardonic force of nature reminiscent of javier bardems anton chigurh in no country for old men. for most of the movie batman merely assists dent in his war on evil. but in the end batman takes the fall for two-faces crimes allowing dents legacy to live on. in this he truly becomes the dark knight because he allows the white knight to triumph. even though evil has apparently won the battle batman refuses to allow evil to win the war. i think many people write off superhero movies assuming they dont hold literary merit-- this was the case with burtons zany batman and joel schumachers cartoon-like batman. i hope the dark knight proves that such a belief is untrue. check out the original comics or the animated series and youll see theres a lot more being said with these characters. the joker is not funny like jack nicholson or cesar romero. hes scary. hes scarier because he doesnt take the world seriously. fortunately the film takes itself seriously and its one of the best in recent years.this is the film to define our generation tarantino has set a standard in movie making for the next 20 years pretty much like hitchcock did for his time this movie a real pleasure to watchthis is the best the dialog between actors was great absence of a single staring role was very appreciated all the character parts were diversify unique and all were developed appropriately every seen had an unexpected twist yet never leaving you confused or trying to lead the audience astray i was completely absorbed never finding a dull moment or having time to try and figure out what was coming next this is unequivocally the best movie of the decade i saw it twicethis is the best of the dark knight trilogy in my opinion. heath ledger is fantastic as the joker also i feel he kind of gets put in the back burner but aaron eckharts harvey dent/ two face is also fantastic and the special effects on his face are incredible. bale will always be my favourite batman and this story is brilliant especially the tension between the two boats at the end. kind of annoying they changed the actor of the rachel character only to have her go and get killed but thats only one small gripe in an otherwise perfect film. id also like to mention the fantastic opening sequence in the bank that has to be one of my favourite scenes in any film hopefully the second man of steel film will be as fantastic as this second dark knight moviethis is the best movie ive ever seen. it has everything  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece. pulp is cult. this is the best movie i have ever seen. in a way i feel i am in a prison of life myself. restricted to doing certain things. sometimes i get frustrated and feel as i should runaway to some place where i could feel free. i hope and dream for it sometime. this movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. i love andy dufresne most in this movie. although critics say tim robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role. i can go on and say more but i said the most important thing which i feel whenever i watch it. i am glad to visit imdb. i never heard of it before. some 7 years ago i saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. only other movie which even comes close to this is citizen kane. but that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom. i give it 11/10.this is the best movie i have ever seen how can you hate it the acting is stunning its silly the best i think is bale batman this movie is great batman gordon and dent fight to keep crime of the streets until the joker comes in and ruins every thing he slowly brings mayhem to gotham city all hope is gone can batman save the day while dent loses his sanity sadly heath ledger died before this movie could be done kind of overrated his performance but great this movie is the soul reason why im a batman fan i wish they sold the comics here oh well more reading wigs for me also good is morgan freeman as fox and aaron as dent so far my only good review go to my page to see my other reviewsthis is the best movie ever but i give you 15 things you may not have known about the shawshank redemption 1. its based on a novella by stephen king the film is based on stephen kings novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption which was published in a short story collection called different seasons. two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films stand by me in 1986 and apt pupil in 1998. only one of them the breathing method has not been turned into a movie. 2. its similar to tolstoy kings novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by russian writer leo tolstoy called god sees the truth but waits. both are about men sent to prison for murders they didnt commit. 3. director frank darabont got a good deal on the rights to kings story he bought the rights from king for $1. 4. it almost had a much different cast castle rock entertainment the studio that made shawshank was co-founded by rob reiner_ãdirector of another king adaptation stand by me_ãand is named after the mythical maine town that provides the setting for many of kings books. after director frank darabont pitched shawshank to the studio reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star tom cruise as andy dufresne and harrison ford as red. 5. the original title was changed to avoid confusion darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to castle rock entertainment. he decided to drop the rita hayworth part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a rita hayworth biopic. during the casting process darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodelthis is the best batman movie out there. heath ledger as the joker was the perfect choice as he made joker almost real. he became the joker and i was so fascinated about his acting skills. such a shame he has past away r.i.p heath ledger. i love christian bale as batman he was a really great choice and i dont really care about how the voice is overrated as people say its really good anyway. the only thing i would have loved was more scarecrow in the movie. even in the dark knight rises and in batman begins i wanted more scarecrow because cillian murphy is such a brilliant actor as scarecrow. this is my favorite movie. everyone should have seen it once at least. in my case ive seen it over 30 times.this is the batman movie i waited my entire life to see adam west the animated series and maybe michael keatons batman were decent but this film is on another level of awesome - and i mean it when i ask why it took so long for someone to do the batman franchise a solid favor. the characters portrayed by christian bale michael caine heath ledger gary oldman aaron eckhart maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman and the music of hans zimmer really come together for swell time for a batman fan. another aspect i enjoy is the city-scape of chicago throughout the film. as a person from the midwest that kind of sweetens the deal.this is tarantinos best film and i think that bruce willis is excellent  john travolta and bruce willis are doing all the work and the result is superb  this film is brilliant this is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out i still cannot find a single person who does not like shawshank redemption. everything in this film is timed well. the story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. the acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. it also has a very clever plot. you are not 100% sure what tim robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. great job by everyone from director actors to script. just the best in movie making.this is really a great movie i loved this movie and it doesnt get all it is a classic and and from my point of view the the best tarantino movie this was made for all movie lovers an extraordinary visual adventure for the spectator the acting is really good and the casting is amazing there you have the two mob killers vincent vega and jules winnfield the duo john travolta and samuel l jackson was the best ive ever seen then you have the boxer: buuuutsch bruce willis there is also the wolf not the one from wall street played by the wonderful hrvey keitel there is also the the extraordinary wife uma thruman brings it to another one as mia wallace the screenplay is really interesting because it involves three parallel stories told to the spectator through different chapters sometimes you have movies known for the one big scene but in this case it is impossible to only take one two or three scenes the whole movie is a classic and a must-see before dyingthis is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say that was 2 hours well spent action begins from the go and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen unlike some other similar movies there is no flying or gravity defying moves here its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive the characters in the movie are really appealing a notable candidate would be the super villain calmhumorous and villainous all at the same time loved his character even though the movie is action packed it comes with a good story a very good one in fact so the bottom line is this is a great movie and worth your time this is one of those movies that you will end up watching again after a while and forget just how good it is i think they should start playing more reruns on the tv as far as the plot its a batman movie. if youve seen one you know what is going on. i think the main reason i enjoy this trilogy more than the others is because it seems to be darker grittier than the others if that makes sense.. the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning. i like all of the movies from this trilogy if i had to choose i would pick this one as the best although ... i will change my mind on occasion they are all really good. if you are looking for must watch movies i dont think you could go wrong with this. if you like it i suggest the rest i include this movie when suggesting movies to my friends all the time. enjoy p.s. - dont forget the popcornthis is one of those movies that you just have to see to believe. the only flaw is that the plot is a bit confusing at first to some viewers but will soon be figured out. some parts are almost like a mystery movie. first i have to explain the joker in the dark knight but im not sure which words to use. ledger played the part like hed been the character all his life and there wasnt a single part that i doubted he was the joker. seriously his words came so easily and everything about the character was done brilliantly. as for batman/bruce wayne the dark voice bale voiced the character with suited him perfectly and once again we see yet another perfect example of flawless acting. the karate the strength the intelligence even... it was all there he also looked just like bruce wayne should have. everyone did an amazing job and the make-up for two-face was stunning. like seriously it was so freaky and cool. this is a good movie. if you like lots of violence and comic book characters. believe me. it was spectacular.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope. this is one of those films that come once in a blue moon. the ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film although shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film. the characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film. what really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly originalwitty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones. just based in a prison men talking to each other. this film does make you feel involved in the film. you feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness. when the film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again - its just that compelling best personal film of all time and best film on imdb and rightly so spectacular film   however it is a requirement that the dialogues are made to be easier to understand rather than being kept in the original tolkien style since you cannot re-see a scene like when you can re-read a part of the book if you did not understand. the choice of actors are undoubtedly most suitable while the costume and prosthetics are as realistic as it gets. howard shore was great and words could not describe the sensations that flow out of each of his pieces. i do not understand why some people actually accuse the film of being terrible in any aspect. the length of the film is a necessity in order to be able to portray the depth of the story and do justice to tolkiens masterpiece. if it was to be any shorter then the film would be missing essential elements required to bring out the majesty of middle-earth. it is simply unfair to say that and this is missing therefore it is not worth watching because if jackson was to include everything each of the trilogy would be over 10 hours long assuming it took everyone that long to read. i for one will not be sitting in a chair for 10 hours and i believe it will also be unpractical to produce a movie that is 10 hours long. it follows that there will be minor discrepancies in the plot but it did not deter the storyline keeping in mind that this is an adaptation. despite some criticism of this film being overrated i believe that it deserves to be ranked as one of the best films ever produced and its grandeur unmatched. overall this is a very enchanting film that is worth watching especially for fans of the lord of the rings. the extended edition is also a personal recommendation as it includes some missing elements that were not necessary for the progression of the plot but adds nicely to the storyline. this is one of the movies of all time. theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. there also enough emotion to round out the experience. the joker is one of the best characters of all time. hes truly amazing. r.i.p mr. heath ledger. christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. its truly a gift to watch them on screen. see this movie it will make you a better person. the ending is perfect and amazing. every time i watch it pick up something new. there was a lot of effort put into this. better than batman begins but not as good as inception. its actually surprisingly under rated.this is one of the most amazing movies ive ever watched. it is based on a steven king book which makes the plot not predictable. the story twists and turns while during the movie it seems that it is heading on a straight path forward. it tells the story of a banker which is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. he is sentenced to life in prison and placed in the shawshank prison where he meets a group of inmates which become his close friends during the decades he spends in prison. the movie tells the story of his life and struggles in the prison environment. any addition to the abstract will spoil the experience and perhaps be a spoiler. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. i remember the first time i saw this movie many more viewing after that the movie just dont get old i was engulfed in it for the whole duration. a must-see movie for anyone and everyone.this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. it has everything the battle scenes are wonderful especially and since the first hour is drama the action really gets to you and you feel like youre really there that is terrified. you care about the characters more than anything in this film so its scary watching a battle scene for the first time because its extremely unpredictable and you dont want your characters to die a few of them do. however the battle scenes are also very well done with a great mix of live-action and cgi. although this is a pg-13 film jackson really went over the limit with his battles  he totally rocked in the previous films. telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. maybe jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in rotk to give lee some film time. that said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. the one new thing that i would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great tolkien artists alan lee and john howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of fotr to the final scenes of rotk. this historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. the lotr enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement. this is one of the best movies about friendship ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies. i found it better than robert redfords castle. morgan freeman was perfect as usual and i can say that tim robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. i wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. i watched most of the films of morgan freeman and i can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like sevenkiss the girlsalong came a spider... but i think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...  all the other glitches are just that. if only you had given us tolkiens rendition here. this is one of the best ive watched the movie trilogy. i dont see tdk just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. created by nolan batsuit-mobile perfect design. the most beautiful thing in the film to return to the jokers and ledger as the joker was created to be such an amazing acting. when good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. thats i think this movie is great. i just did not like the actor who portray the character of rachel dawes. other than that nolan and his team did a great job. they can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than ledger as the joker.this is one of the best batman movies that i have ever seen. i believe that they did a great job. i love dc and this movie was able to remind me why that was. because there are all kind of superheroes. there is only one batman. when you are able to that this role on to the fullest and truly be come the bat.that is when you can make some thing good in to something great. there are a many other good twist and turns. they will live you in shock.the bat will face challenges. some will make him strong and other will leave him almost broken. in these without the joker it would be so lame. he bring the hummer. why so serious batman has all that anyone needs. he with be the catalyst for the whole movie. i have never seen someone out side of the batman cartoon be this go as a joker. when you watch this movie it fell like the joker is real. when you bring to people together that can become the bat and joker that is when you have made as a batman movie this was a once in a life time movie i dont know if anyone could ever be a better joker. if you dont believe what im saying then you need to watch it for your self. the you will understand why i think batman is so great for your self. to me the dark knight should prove one thing to all people. six words only there must always be a batmon.this is one of or maybe the best movie of the century it is so unique when it comes to jumping from different places to different times no other director than quentin tarantino could have made this movie so special just take a look at lets say reservoir dogs here he use the same teqnique but in a totally different way he is very aware of his one directing tarantino and he seems like a very intelligent person therefore i say that pulp fiction is a movie that indeed deserves 10 starsthis is one of my favorite movies.i love the acting and characters.i think it is intense and suspenseful.i think it has one of the best versions of the joker.i like how it deals with the corruption of the police force.my favorite part is when batman interrogated joker.i think it was unique that batman could not save rachelsince usually the hero saves someone that has been kidnapped.i liked harvey going bad because it shows that even really good people can turn.i dont blame it on the joker though because harvey was a little bad when he interrogated the guy in the chair.people in internal affairs also called him harvey two-face implying he had a darker side. i would recommend this movie to any batman or drama fan.this is one of my favorite movies of all time. my favorite parts are the characters of sam jackson and john travolta jules winfield and vincent vega. quentin tarantino did a fantastic job. other movies have tried to compare but none will. my good friend out in los angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of jules and vincent driving around town and having a discussion about vincents recent travels abroad. and the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. and i think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. everything from the gold watch speech to harvey keitels dialogue. quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. he combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.this is one of my all-time favorite movies the subtle details of this move amaze me every time i watch it my only problem is getting friends to watch the movie that havent seen it during the whole movie i sit there watch this part as they are talking amongst themselves then at the end of the movie it doesnt make sense to them this is a great movie and i thank quentin tarantino for making it the way he did there is nothing about this movie that i would change i just wish i could make everyone sit down and pay close attention so they also could appreciate this movie the way i and all the other voters do thanksthis is on of my favorite movies of all times not to mention that quentin tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is the performances of john travolta and samuel l jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more let us not forget the cameo performance either wonderful job to quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen the screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come if you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it this is definitely a film to last through the timesthis is not only a great comic book movie not only a great crime thriller movie but one of the best movies of all time. the best villain in all of dc comics the joker comes to life as he is portrayed by heath ledger who literally gave the performance of his life as he tragically passed away before the films release. bale is fantastic once again as batman returning with that epic voice and giving the fans once of the best movie quotes ever im not wearing hockey pads. the tone for this movie is dark and really gritty and takes nearly all the comic book elements and throws them out the window making this an epic movie for anyone to enjoy not just comic book fans. the soundtrack cinematography and direction for this movie is amazing just go an watch it if you havent already. 10/10this is my favorite movie of all time i was 15 when i first saw this at that time i didnt think movies could get any better than true lies pulp fiction changed that for me it set me on my quest to get a better knowledge of film from then on i wanted to see films that had a good plot and that showcased good acting it made me want to see good films ive said goodbye to those pathetic action and comedy movies i began to see the films of bergman scorsese deniro kubrick altman the list goes on and on 10 out of 10this is my 1st review on imdb  i dont like writing reviews for a movie after all its just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like morgan free-man youll love of him after this one.... great movie... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i dont want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :this is indeed the best movie i have ever seen i dont know how people actually hate it its a totally original movie its got everything from violence to extreme profanity this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for surethis is hands down the best movie i have ever seen quentin tarantino did such a good job i dont see how sam jackson didnt win the best supporting actor award the only thing this movie needs is robert de niro and they got it all this is such a good moviethis is for sure not the movie you can just leave behind in the theaters it is a must to have this in your movie collection. and like any true trilogy this movie is not the same if you have not seen the previous two installments. if you grew up and always loved batman and marvel movies and comics this one will not disappoint you. it is great to see all the characters come back and look and act even that much more fitting then you remembered them. christian bale played an extraordinary batman and i might say he could be one of the best actors to play batman. in my eyes this is an exceptional superhero movie it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.this is filmmaking at its apex though i would hardly argue that this film is the greatest which is what many imdb users relate after theyve just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next titanic or matrix hype machine bursts their way i must say that pulp fiction added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s and who can argue with that indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldnt be more right when the film came out a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipnessbeing hip is cool but i wouldnt necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at men in black which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that pulp fiction has become so what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd its exactly this spiritualitywatching the film i remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird california former video clerks world view the film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of scorseses goodfellas and roman polanskis rosemarys baby it is the scene where travolta crashes his malibu into eric stoltzs front yard and brings the oded thurman inside his house as rosanna arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by andrez sekula moves back and forth between arquette and travolta and stoltz lurching over thurman thats the scorsese part then as stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of stoltz reminders of the scene where polanski photographed ruth gordon in rosemarys baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction such a phrase can be used to describe pulp fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience this movie subliminally makes you a part of the action i recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over natural born killers now dont get me wrong oliver stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like im going to use my artistic license to satirize the over-the-top violence of popular culture by making a movie replete withover-the-top violence in the style of david spade its called hypocrisy oliver--check into it anyways i digress anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema you can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your tastebut you cant deny the artistry that went into it morality for all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty i suggest you rent the family favorite the santa clause and count how many times disney shamelessly milks its own products or if god is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a christmas film or in any family film what impressed me the most when i first saw pulp fiction was its inclusion of god at all many generation-x filmmakers paging kevin smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light you can have those other indie favorites chasing amy and good will huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies matt damon and ben affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the smashing pumpkins in a simpsons episode: alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth then you can have them compare that to jules awakening i was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity and youll see how tarantino turned the mythic gen-x stereotype on its head as well pulp fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship everthis is definitely the best film of the 90s closely followed by seven and fight club tarantino breaks the molds of the gangster film and gives a great and at many time comedic look into the lives of two hit men bruce willis also gives his best performance ever mostly because he doesnt say much in the film the music is just perfect as with almost all of tarantinos films if you havent watch this film watch it right now i think for me at least the most drawn out part of the film is vinces interactions with mia mostly because i find myself partial to sam jackson anyways this film is a great go watch it then watch it again then ask yourself what does marsellus wallace look likethis is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once. tim robbins you make my days a little brighter -- thank youthis is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen. christopher nolan reached new heights and created a masterpiece. let me start with the acting. heath ledger is one of the most underrated actors ever. he fit the role of the joker much better than his previous actor jack nicholson. every word he said was more insane than the word before it. his list of famous quotes stretches more than 100 yards long. he is scary mischievous and downright psychotic. his crazy schemes almost always come together and they they push their victims to the limits. christian bale also performed extremely well but not as well as ledger. he was a great bruce wayne and his part was terrifically written. aaron eckhart and gary oldman also performed extremely well and their characters helped make the movie what it is: amazing. the suspense in this movie pushes you to the edge of your patience and when it finally pays off oh boy is it good i can barely find anything wrong with this movie. it is nearly flawless.this is by far the best of the 3 sequels. i personally feel this has got to be the best movie of 2003. it is a must see. the fight scenes and the acting have truly culminated into one of the best cinema experiences i have ever experienced.this is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. i am a morgan freeman fan and apart from driving miss daisy i have loved all his movies that i have seen. the shawshank redemption stands above all. i think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. the only other prison movie i like as much is the classic clint eastwood movie escape from alcatraz. the shawshank redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the dvd i still watch when it is on tv. 15 years since its release and i still havent seen anything i like more. i would recommend this movie to everyone and if you havent seen it yet you must be living in a cave or something. if you are in a cave get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10this is an awesome movie that has crime thrill and comedy you wont be bored even for a single minute in this 154 minute movie as the story is very interesting and entertaining the story line is written in such a way that it prevents you to get out of your seat at any point of time the four stories blend themselves in a very beautiful way that you have might have never seen before everyone did superb acting in the movie especially john travolta and bruce willis quentin tarantino has put in some ultimate dialogues in this movie that make the movie special 10 on 10 for this superb movie must watch for allthis is an amazing film let me get that out of the way first there is no doubt about it the cast list alone is impressive samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis and many other top celebrities along with walk on parts for steve buscimi and even quentin tarantino himself the overall plot of pulp fiction could be quite hard to follow as it isnt set out chronologically but you will figure out whats happening when eventually ive watched this film around 5 or 6 times and every time i watch it i notice something new the first time i watched it i thought it was more of a crime action/thriller but you will soon realise that it can be classed quite easily as a comedy alot of the jokes are well hidden and there are a few in-jokes but anyone on this website will probably get them one point though this film is not for the faint hearted there are some scenes of violence and general not being nice one scene in particular which i seriously hope you wouldnt want to see i wont say any more but yuckthis is an amazing film it keeps you on your toes from the start all the way until the end i would suggest it for anyone to watch although its 2 and a half hours long not once was i bored i would suggest this film to anyone it really is amazing its amazing gripping thrilling and highly intelligent it has a superb twist and you never expect what happens this film is exciting and im so glad i got to see it for once id also suggest watching the trailer as it doesnt ruin the film although most of them do i would happily watch this film over and over as its surprising but yet it is still interestingthis is a very very very great film. its my all time favorite. first of all the acting is f**king great. my favorite actor in the entire film is easily morgan freeman. he should have won that oscar the fact that he didnt is a f**king disgrace. now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. now the story line is brilliant. andy dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover so he is sentenced to shawshank state prison. there he develops a friendship with a prisoner named red. the sets in this movie are great. as expected. so in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.this is a very dark movie and heath ledgers joker is the darkest it gets. the entire movie is like an eerie roller coaster ride. theres not much cgi here only a truly haunting  and dashes of the jokers mesmerizing lines. the action is kept from being overblown and thats really encouraging in this era of mindless cgi-driven summer blockbusters. more importantly the story of bruce wayne is taken to new high or low. this is unlike any comic book movie you have ever seen one that youll keep coming back to. all of the actors deserve their kudos but ledger overshadows them all.this is a superb film in all possible ways the acting is astonishing the camera work sublime and the  is fantastic this is the best work travolta has ever done and even bruce willis gives a great performance a stellar supporting cast includes tim roth amanda plummer and eric stoltz in the famous needle scene rent this i guarantee you will not be disappointedthis is a must watch movie in every once lifelove it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie. this movie give a valuable message if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose hopethis is a movie for anyone who loves science fiction the film had a long playtime but after ive seen the movie i understood why its a galactic experience with such detail and sense of a space simulator did you find movie gravity was cool so is this movie light years better it has a style similar to 2001 a space odyssey but everything in this movie has so much more to effort this isnt an adventure its more like an explosion of details and experiences through a drama perspective it has it all for the fanatical science fiction nerd to thrive and the movie does that to the maximum an excellent moviethis is a masterpiece that words cant describe.in my opinion and many others this is the best movie if not ever at least of the 21st century no doubt. heath ledger was so so so awesomewho could ever thought that he could be the joker and not only be but playing it in the best way possible.c.bale is my favorite batman of all time and aaron eckhart was pretty good too. here has a 9.0 rating which in my opinion is not enough it should have had at least 9.5 but hey after all it has 1.2 million voters and 47.5% gave it a 10. this movie is epic is just so good i will never understand those who hate on this movie but this movie is so good and the best one out there.if you havent seen the movie go see it now you have no idea what youre missing even though i dont think there are many humans that havent watch this movie. i would say i give it a 10 but it seems so little for this movie so i give it 11/10.this is a masterpiece tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by john travolta and uma thurman pulp fiction is perfection i went into this film with high expectations i had recently been introuduced to tarantino through his previous feature reservoir dogs which was also very good and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of hollywoods best willis jackson travolta but there was no need to be as i was delivered a masterclass in film a very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase a risky move by tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it my belief is it contained his soul the way in which tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the leastthis is a great movie. being the second movie in the dark knight trilogy this is definitely the best. yes it can be disturbing at certain times but once you get past the violence and the dark undertone its a great movie that anyone above the age of 11 can enjoy. also the actors in this movie are amazing heath ledger plays a great joker and even has the laugh down. he is by far the best portrayal of the joker. also christian bale is the best portrayal of batman that i have seen and im sure that many fans would agree. he has the voice the looks and the acting skills to pull off the most bad ass superhero of all time.this is a film that demands your viewing visually emotionally and mentally do not let that scare you let it entice you and draw upon your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery i suggest you see this film with someone whether that be a friend family or significant other prepare for a few tears a few laughs and prepare to be baffled and mesmerized this is a film that pushes many limits and some might say the limits of its audience but i see that as a positive this film will remind you of 2001 the tree of life apollo 13 and insomnia for those looking for the link to christopher nolans other work insomnia is your best bet this carries all of the same acting writing and directing marvels of that film dark knight fans may be shied away and fans looking for the action of inception may leave feeling cheated but ignore them this is a film for people it is a personal and human film its most tender moments will cause views to draw on emotions and relationships in their own life it reaches beyond the screen asking some very personal as well as philosophical questions the film in the end may not have all the answers or even explain itself completely but is does not suffer from these aspects but rises higher because of them the movie is not perfect but it is not supposed to be perfect just like the first maps drawn or the first exploration into unknown waters there will be missteps and wrong turns i am keeping this short to avoid giving anything away go see this film with an open mind and it will reward you in every way it is a giant step forward in modern cinema it is a film that will be discussed for years to come and it is a film that has the power to affect the viewer something not many films in todays market can boast i cannot remember the last time a movie truly left me speechless there have been films i have wanted to watch again right away films i needed to process or films that had me deep in thought this film not only achieved all of the above but truly and honestly left me speechless the film will demand a great deal of the viewer including the three hour runtime but like any great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its partsthis is a cinematic masterpiece it is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema it contains arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film everybody in the world should see this movie no matter what age 5 starsthis has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. i first saw it when it made it to british tv and have only just got round to buying it and ive watched it a few times since then. the characters have so much depth you end up loving them the more you watch this film. the acting is first class. the cinematography is first class. the sound is first class. the casting is first class. the dialogue is fantastic. all these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer. this is one of the few times ive seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. it seems to me it expands a little on stephen kings novella. this film deserves the rating it has here on imdbthis film was absolutely amazing. i have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.i like it.i watched this film since 2009.but it is in the my mind still.the acted and special effects are very good. i think orlando bloom is the best actor in the film.because i love archery. i like legolas.he killed two elephants with one arrow.he is very good archer. sarumans army are very strong.the goods is weaker than sarumans army.but goods are win every time.so the goods win the war with aragorns strong. this film very good.really i recommend watch this film to you. this film to do who thanks.this film ranks second among my all time favourites. the only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that i am obsessed with monty pythons the holy grail. shawshank is a beautifully crafted film with one of the best endings i have ever seenthis film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. the characters played by morgan freeman and tim robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that i cried and i laughed with them while watching it for the first time. we learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like the shawshank redemption.once upon a time i was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. then some suggested me to watch this. what happened next was simply miracle. the pain endured by tim robbins was no less than mine. but it was hope that kept him alive. that infused a new joy in my life and i achieved success in very little amount of time. the dialogues are simply straight yet touching. the movie has universal appeal - it can move anyone because characters played by freeman and robbins are so close to heart. double thumbs up to stephen king and frank darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema. this movie was not made for oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in imdb 250. it was made for common people like us. humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.this film manages to redeem hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichê©s and predictability. darabont shows us that artists still work in the hollywood studios and production facilities. these artists show their capability to produce artthis film is the best film ever made. this is because it concludes an epic story which is full of complex characters and amazing scenes.each has a different quest and most get tied up at the end of the film. in addition this film have various epic moments which hold the pure essence of film making and great story telling and this film is full of emotion which will attach to the viewer while they watch it. lastly this film has no points which get boring or uninteresting. therefore every second of this film is epic due to its detailed battle scenes and complex character relations like frodo and sam which give warm emotion and courage to the film.this film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. it has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of middle earth. if you take nothing from this film other than this you will be the richer: this is an important a vital film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it.this film is really an amazing movie timeless. one of my all time favorites. about the long-can write something in a movie. masters said everything i needed there is not yet aware of the movie and i watched it for people to watch i would like to invite. than you. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. if you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. as i bet youll want to see this one more than once.this film is pure class. i do not want to give anything away but heath ledgers performance in this is the best performance i have ever seen in my lifetime. shame it overshadows gary oldmans amazing performance as well. every aspect of this film is amazing the ideas the performances and the screenplay i remember coming out of the cinema in pure shock of how good this movie is. need to watch. incredible. christopher nolan is a geniusthis film is phenomenal easily top 5 or even the best film of all time it is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film but when i watch this movie i feel happy i listen to every word and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening it is shocking that this film only won one oscar very frustrating to even think about it but most people seem to agree this is much better than forrest gump i feel myself hating that movie for these reasons samuel l jackson should have won an oscar his performance is incredible i hang on every word he says he also has a lot of memorable lines the characters in this film act so well together that it doesnt even seem like their acting but are instead meaning it the soundtrack couldnt have been any better it is perfect tarantinos talent is displayed in full view here at the top of his abilities this film is not serious it is more relaxed and entertaining but done so well you take it seriously if that makes sense i rarely have strong feelings for most films but this film is different than most films different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines this film is tied with the good the bad and the ugly for the best film of all time no film will ever be like pulp fiction ever again unless they copy it that says a lot id recommend this film to anyone everybody needs to see this film it is the best of tarantinos masterpieces i cant believe people cry about this films success 1 star ratings by people that cant handle this filmthis film is perfect from the begining to the end in my humble opioion this is one of thoes films which only come along every so often and totally amaze peopleothers being usual suspectsshawshank and the godfather. i think the greatness of this film lies in the way it makes you think the way it intertwines a few stories into one and also by the amazing cast i dont want to bore you by going on for too long about this filmeven though i could go on for some time ill simply advise you to watch this film because once you have youll never look back 10/10this film is just too good for words to describe go and see this spectacle it will blow anyone away im not the biggest fan of fantasy adventures but this has blown me away and what an ending for the the brilliant trilogy. return of the king is better than the other two lotr films in my opinion but all three films are a joy to watch over and over again cant praise peter jackson enough as i said earlier on he created a peace of film making which is too good for words to describe and everyone should go witness this spectaclethis film is brilliant just brilliant. i watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended i knew it would stay with me forever. every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies the 70s had the godfather and apocalypse now the 80s had platoon and raging bull the 90s had the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction and the 2000s had gladiator and the lord of the rings. there were a lot of good films in the 90s and this is up there with the best . the story is about a man called andy dufresne tim robbins who is wrongly convicted and sent to the shawshank prison. when there he meets red morgan freeman and then the story takes off. the acting is incredible and freeman and robbins deliver the performances of their career the script is incredible another great collaboration between steven king and frank darabont and it didnt win one single oscar this could have been good enough for three oscars at the least true the competition forrest gump and pulp fiction were good films but the shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple. so if you havent seen the shawshank redemption buy it rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever be prepared to be blown away.this film is amazingand coolthis is the best than the orderthis is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great  i love this movie and this movie it was greatthis film is amazing because it has a great screen-play it is at the same time an excellent thriller and an intelligent comedy and we only can see it in a few brilliant movies a fabulous director quentin tarantino that had done other great movies like jackie brown or reservoir dogs and well actors and actresses mainly john travolta with the best movie of his career the incredible samuel l jackson and uma thurman i think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of cinema that i saw in my life i think its incredible how a great movie like pulp fiction didnt won the oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent forrest gump pulp fiction isnt only one of the best movies of the 90s it is for me one of the best movies of everthis film is about hope friendship and redemption. it has solid performances from morgan freeman tim robbins and bob gunton the warden. freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. you experience everything through himthis film is a true fairy tale its dark its raw and its written from the dark raw experience of women maleficent is about what happens when your prince turns into a frog its the personal inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most its about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself its message is that profound the critics complaining about this film want fairy tales to stay in the same onelovefitsall mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find romantic love and marry a good prince or princess and you will live happily ever after safe from any pain or sorrow but real life is a lot messier than that its actually evidence of how rare it is to see womens unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it no matter this film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster no matter what the critics say and its equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies androll credits people are more complicated than that fairy tale we are sold in every other action and adventure film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that its message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us this is one such film woolverton and jolie have crafted a masterpiece dont miss itthis film is a classic and its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp snappy humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again by now ive seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up i wont go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say you can download the script from the net and it literally jumps out at you its an incredible read now if the script is that good no wonder travolta and keitel wanted to do it an awesome film - the no1 film ever made in my estimationthis film had so much energy the way angelina aced her strong amazing performance did this films justice she pushed herself to build a relationship with maleficent although critics were skeptical  the film itself has made $745 million most likely for jolies performance i loved her in this film she is the only reason i choose to see this film again and again oscar nomiantion is for sure worthy for her role elle fanning gave a sweet yet stunning performance also she gave aurora what she needed for fans who have not yet seen this film if you are expecting the orinal  you will be let down this is showing the film from a new point of viewthis film blew me away and it is hard to describe why seeing it together with 1500+ captivated and enthusiastic people at one of the berlinale friedrichstadtpalast screenings surly helped yet what makes this film so unique and touching is its deep humanity although it is a fictional piece you cant help not to relate to the actors as if it would be a documentary every scene feels like real life i know that this is not necessarily a good thing to say about a movie but it is meant as a compliment the actors deliver an outstanding performance while much has already been said about the main characters i was also deeply impressed by the performance of the side characters as well as an example the actor of the second husband of olivia excels in one of the most emotionally straining scenes of the movie the dialogs are touching and feel just natural there are so many scenes and details in the movie where you feel unbelievable close to the actors when patricia arquette says as mother olivia i thought there would be more you instantly think about your own family life and its constant flux i surely hope that this movie will make it to as many screens as possible also i hope that no distributor will force additional editing on it it is perfect as it is and worth any minute if you like people in general and families in particular you will love this moviethis film along with all of the the lord of the rings trilogy are the most amazing films i have ever seen i have also read the book and the ending could have stuck to it more spoiler: saruman dies at bag end in the hands of grima wormtonguethe shire is burnt and turned bad because of them- a great scene but still entirely excellent. i especially love the fact that viggo mortensen aragorn sings and billy boyd peregrin/ pippin took... all the actors and actresses are terrific the film deserves the 11 oscars that it received. i am a peter jackson fan and tolkienite all the books are brilliant and the films match them... such a fan that i have the soundtracks i want to thank also howard shore the london philharmonic orchestra ben del maestro renee fleming sir james galaway and annie lennox for the soundtrack... and to enya sheila chandra elizabeth fraser and emiliana torrini for the fellowship of the ring and the two towers soundtrack. i cried....many a time... all i can say is watch it... see for yourself :this doesnt bode well for my reading career gone girl is spectacular a strong contender for this years best picture i couldnt recommend it more highly reading the book isnt necessary the differences between the textual and visual are minimal reconsider the commitment lingering on your bookshelf this is one flick you wont want to miss if youve got a better half bring him or her along both men and women will thoroughly enjoy its long 145 minutes total but should hold your interest throughout the screenplay for gg is by gillian flynn the same woman who penned the novel if gone girl offers any inclination toward the quality of gfs alternative texts lets hope sharp objects and dark places are greenlit director david fincher doesnt have a distinct public persona like tarantino or an iconic physical appearance like scorceses that doesnt detract from his mastery of feature film direction iconic motion pictures like fight club se7en the social network and the girl with the dragon tattoo highlight his filmography if a storys a stairway gone girl is a multitiered double escalator its extremely well written and the tension is like radio static vibrating angrily amidst the coiling  the pacing is kinetic the story constantly switching gears the humor is occasional in a realistic fashion the selfawareness is pointedly subtle the characters are sympathetic and well rounded is it even necessary to mention neil patrick harriss performance? cant we just assume he was fantastic from now on? how about ben affleck everyones favorite punching bag? folks who doubted him should be flogged with a sofa cushion upon recommending gone girl a friends initial hesitation hinges on afflecks involvement first of all thats like saying youre missing the nsync concert because you dont like jts pipes benny was never bad at acting by any stretch of the imagination folks cite 2003s gigli and daredevil as fleck daddys downfall i cant speak to the former but a final thought on the latter at fourteen years old a group of friends and i thoroughly enjoyed daredevil in the theater plus it gave us a walk in the shoes of a blind person whether we appreciated it or not we were educated on a lifestyle none of us understood i can still cite multiple scenes in detail and i havent seen daredevil since that initial viewing my basic point is dont skip gone girl because of a strong opposition to afflecks acting ability rosamund pike is lightsout shes a semiunknown but a look at her filmography proves she deserves more notoriety ive a feeling well be seeing more of her in the future the remainder of the cast is just as good but too much detail may trigger a spoiler so ill leave it at that the warm weather left with the hummingbirds but at least there are solid flicks repopulating theatersthis cant be called a feature film. this is a masterpiece like beethovens symphony. it is an insult to call this a movie. no matter how many times you watch you love it. it is music to the eyes. while enough has been said about the plot characters comparison history context i wont delve into the specifics but give the review on a very high level. this applies to both the novice as well as the critic. from so many amazing things about the movie the greatest one is the music that is what has its effect on our minds while perfectly befitting the characters plot flow of the movie. together with the characters of hero villain and the shady 3rd character the viewer feels he is the protagonist. immersive. joyous. scary. hopeful. the pace of movie the generous full blown action no holes barred spectacular scenes massive destruction grand setting is fabulous. not a single scene act dialog in this movie i believe is not appreciable. it just blends in perfectly. its a treat. you need this in your permanent collection and watch it in a home theater with full volume. listen to the tracks build an atmosphere of chaos cultivate a climate of anarchy darkness before you watch and even after the movie ends let the music roll on. this will stay with you for months. how the talented actors and the even more talented director pull off such a massive but delicate spectacular but deep grand but humane movie is a wonder in itself. this is my first ever review that too in 2013 5 years after the movie am still a fan of it. i saw the movie without any context of batman nolan i simply stepped into a movie hall one rainy evening in mumbai it was almost empty.... and at the end of it i sat alone contemplating how such a flabbergasting movie it cud be. i went home did some research saw this movie 5 more times including once in imax. my friends tell me im an ambassador of this movie but they liked it too. although i went in too deep to understand the nuances character development dialogs and the working behind it. one of them rightly said this is not an action movie. do not categorize it as such. just because it is fictional it cant be miscategorised this is an opera a drama an anthropology of our times.this a great movie if you liked this movie then i really recommend reservior dogs i just want to say one thing though what was in the briefcase well i think its marcellus wallaces soul i think he sold his soul to the devil i say this because the combination to the briefcase was 666theres nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies and theres no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. i always go for 1994 mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. i mean its pretty tough to find a person that doesnt have either forrest gump pulp fiction or the shawshank redemption in their personal top ten. while the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents to some people forrest gump is too much of a tearjerker while pulp fiction apparently glorifies violence too much the shawshank redemption is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. its a movie that goes beyond matters of taste the story writing and acting are so undeniably good that its tough to come up with a counterargument. writer/director frank darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer particularly when it comes to bit characters. you can also see this in the somewhat inferior the green mile characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. the amazing performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman do the rest. the best movie ever made its definitely up there.theres a sag in the film not in this film this is awesome. the trilogythere will never be another superhero film that can beat the dark knights its unbelievably good. it continues on from batman begins showing a more experienced batman in a darker gotham city. the dark knight shows batman pushed to his limits leaving the audience questioning whether he will give in. everything you could want from a realistic batman film is there and i cant think of many ways that this masterpiece could be improved. every scene is amazing and heath ledgers acting is better than any ive ever seen before making it impossible to look away from the screen. it is not necessary to watch batman begins prior to the dark knight however to fully understand the story id recommend it as batman begins is an outstanding example of an origin story so you might as well see the full trilogy.there is nothing i like more than a good thriller that is without a doubt my favourite genre that being said it is quite rare that i came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last at best i have only come across some pretty great ones however gone girl definitely takes the prize for the best one that i have ever seen i wish that i had read the book first so that i could comment on how faithfully it has been adapted however since the screenplay is written by flynn herself i can imagine that it doesnt hold much difference only in the character depth which is always better developed through the work of a novel for obvious reasons what i can say though is that it certainly was safe in the hands of the brilliantly talented david fincher fincher is simply one of the best directors out there after all this is the same man that has given us such memorable gems as the social network 2010 zodiac 2007 panic room 2002 seven 1995 and many more simply put gone girl was destined for his spectacular direction and boy did he deliver gone girl is a remarkable piece of filmmaking on so many different levels the story itself is one of the most thought provoking and engaging that i have ever had the pleasure of viewing it had me wonderfully gripped right from the off its not often that i find myself dissecting and questioning the events throughout the entire thing but this one brilliantly had my mind rollercoastering all the way through it twists and turns with such unique and refreshing mastery that you feel like the whole thing is happening around you gone girl is the screen definition of a spectacular page turner and fincher delivers it with some of the best direction that he has ever done i cant help but think that in the hands of anyone else this film would not have been executed with the same quality of impact that the story deserved this for me is one of his best films if not the best no small feat considering his fantastic library of work a novel adaptation of this calibre though cannot rely purely on the talents of its director to tell the story without a great cast to act it out it is nothing more than a great story weakly portrayed fortunately gone girl succeeds in this too i get pretty sick and tired with the constant ben affleck bashing to be honest i dont think that anyone can deny that he is an awesome director and a talented writer ill say that straight off but whilst he may have been less than aweinspiring an actor in his earlier years ill defy anybody to tell me that he has not improved with age i think people just need to accept the fact that he is the next batman and stop being so ridiculous about it which is basically what it comes down to i see far bigger stars that have had much longer careers that dont have the fraction of acting ability that affleck does affleck is so multidimensional in the role of nick dunne that you really dont know what to make of him as a character all you can only ever really do is speculate on his guilt and innocence and formulate your own ideas concerning what may or may not have happened dunnes cocksure and blas demeanour is a fantastic shield when trying to determine the level of involvement in his wifes disappearance if any at all he is uniquely likable and dislikable at the same time this is absolute credit to afflecks performance and capabilities he completely nails and owns this character from start to finish that being said as great as he is i think the best performance of the film truly belongs in the hands of rosamund pike as nicks wife amy she is unarguably magnificent there is not too much that i can say about her character to be honest only that pike really does show the strength of her acting skills and i loved every moment that she was on screen overall gone girl is a splendid thought provoking mystery with plenty of twists and turns that will have you gripped throughout it is a marvellous guessing game and one you will still be talking about long after the end credits have rolled it is ultimately satisfying and rewarding in its climax and you wont get to the end and question why you bothered watching it in the first place gone girl also has a great supporting cast including neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickins carrie coon and missi pyle among others if you have not had the pleasure of seeing this yet then i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunningthere is nothing i like more

i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunningthere is not a fault that you can declare with a film that was shot for 12 years kept the exact same cast and delivered a powerful movie of a boy named mason its great to go and criticise movies but there was a moment that i could flaw this film with the unnoticeable changes of years it provides you with so many segments that create such power moods that you can relate to as a person growing up i call this a feel good film it has its funny moments and quite frankly was enjoyable all the way through there are dark scene that were delivered quite perfect that really left me pinned back in my seat after watching the trailer it was fair to say i had already classed this movie as beautiful and it sure was indeed finding a movie these days to please you is quite a difficult task whereas this movie has a simple plot growing up how you deal with yourself and what you will come across the movie really makes you feel as though you are growing up with it adapting to the really likable characters is consistent there is a lot of movies that have blew me away this year and by the forgotten director in my eyes linklater has really shown up to me and provides a movie that will feed your every instinct in what you love about a movie boyhood is beautifulthere is no shortage to say that peter jackson and his staff of creators and actors have left its mark in the history of visual story telling for as long as time shall go. history will continue to revile this gem of our time and i feel lucky to be part of its birth and continuation to fill the hearts of love for films. its visual achievements stand proud even ten years down the evolution of movie crafting and howard shore delivers a  which will define brilliance in motion picture soundtracks. it is truly one of the rare films i watch dearly once a year and still gives me chills smiles and touch the deep heartstrings i so seldom touch in real life. it is a reminder of the beauty in life and that darkness is but a passing no matter how great. it is indeed a movie which is pro-lifethere is no other word to describe this film everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion there is humour violence shock it has everything a film needs and they are all portrayed in a sensational way for people who havent seen the film it is a collection of stories all jumbled out of chronological order and all are somehow intertwined the individual stories themselves are wonderful and i would watch them on their own the way that tarantino has put all the stories together so that we still arent sure how they all connect until right at the end is amazing the film somehow has a gritty reality to it even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous they are believable all the same the amazing thing is that tarantino always manages to produce incredible films this is imo the best film that he has made and probably ever made and for any fan or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet go out and buy it nowthere is no film that has touched me and few that have touched anyone as much as this one tarantino has a penchant for violence as do many of the big name actors like jackson and willis but so does the human race theres more to us and more to the film the fact that it creates so many unanswered questions the fact that i can watch it again and again and still see new things even its tie-ins to other qt movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it its ironic that such a pulp/pop film could do it but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with reb flags and a world of people with accents from faraway places it adds to a mystery - where is it from fabiennes accent why is she esmerelda villalobos here none of these are crucial to the plot just like subway chatter and personal romance are not necessary for survival yet we find ourselves doing them day in and day out why does marsellus have a band-aid whats in the briefcase why does mindless violence fascinate us why are we enamored with the intricatethere is no doubt that this film breaks through as one of the best film adaptations of a comic book. christopher nolan has taken the world of batman and turned into real life creating a sense that how would the world of batman look and feel if it was in our world. right from the start in the opening scene shot in imax displaying a deep detailed view of gotham you immediately become immersed in this film. as the film progresses you get drawn more and more into the film it starts to seem less fantasy and has a realness to it mirroring our real world. when casting of heath ledger as the joker was released many people could not see him being this iconic villain heath was sweet nice and had that gentleman quality to him that you see in his other films. when you first see him in the opening bank robbery scene when he takes his mask off you right away see that this was a new joker that was not seen before with scars and messy make-up and messy hair. it has a sense of psychotic craziness with a hint of master mind that is unpredictable in nature but completely thought out in detail. in the later scenes you see the joker only wants one thing and that is chaos to watch the world burn. he kills a few people without even passing a glance at them but can not find himself to kill the batman it plays out as a yin-yang. batman showing that the world is full of people ready to believe in good but the joker shows how even the best can be broken down. you dont realize it is heath behind the make-up and character you immerse yourself into thinking that is the joker. the story has a mix of high action parts as well as slower parts bouncing back and forth creating a dynamic range that isnt to much or to little but keeps your attention through out. it is a true master piece that is a must to watch whether you are a die hard batman fan or not it is a great movie through out.there is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. its his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. that defines a legend. and this is what batman stands for. batman is not just another comic character but its a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. fear- the most dominated emotion mankind has ever witnessed. batman is no exception he still has fear he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. but what is interesting and inspirational about batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- brain thats why he is my favourite comic character and this time batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the joker. a spell bounded performance by heath ledger as the joker. though he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror joker creates. in start i was bit confused as his performance reminded me of jack nicholson from the first batman movie but later i realised that this is for real. he did not imitate jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. the best part about heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- fearless. there are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. here heath is perfect as a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of gotham. the fear of batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from batmans reach. and thats where the joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill batman. now with his perverted mind the joker is behind batmans life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. at one end joker has no fear and on the other batman has a responsibility of saving gotham. now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from breaking box office records this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. batman series is an action series. when you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when its required but with an unexpected style. dark intense and a complete batman style. the batman movies are famous for its back ground music and the dark knight is no exception. specially when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. i felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. my eyes popped out while watching those scenes. to mention batmans grilling session with the joker is a masterpiece. the scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. harvey dents character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. i was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. rachel dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. her involvement in the movie is much focused than katie holmes in batman begins but the point im making here is the glam factor in this movie. she was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. nevertheless the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences spinal chords. my favourite is the chase scene where joker is trying best to catch harvey dent and how batman comes in between. this is where batman says asta la vista and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike its called batpod i can imagine how excited you will be when you know that batman is now going to catch the joker and joker is happy that batman has missed his shot. this is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. unlike other hollywood flicks the dark knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 î_ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you wont mind spending that much time watching it. many times we feel that some movies couldve been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight thats not the case. its mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. i was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. perfect ending well the dark knight is just a beginning. now im expecting the penguin and the riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. as i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after this movie im mad about not just batman but each and every part of his movies music and the joker. now while im rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of batman series you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman- choice is yoursthere is a reason the shawshank redemption has been at #1 of the imdb top 250 for as long as i can remember. it is probably the best movie that has ever been made. not because of the thrilling special effects it hardly has any. not because of the daring experimental innovations it has brought us it is a quite straightforward movie. but because of its simple beautiful storyline and its great characters. they send you here for life. thats exactly what they take. the strength of this movie is that darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. to show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in shawshank prison. we can truly understand how a man can become institutionalized. how people get used to living under a repressive regime and cant face changing it. we see how the old brooks cant deal with the world around him and commits suicide. how red faces the same challenges when he cant take a leak without asking permission. inside the joint these men had a certain standing they were important people. being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you. - why did you do it - i didnt since you ask. - you gonna fit right in. half of the movie we dont know for sure whether andy is guilty or not. it doesnt matter so much. what is important is not his past. rehabilitated what does that word even mean in prison you live a whole different life. with whole different rules. without a past. or a future. andy is the exemption. he shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. by never accepting our destiny. by never giving up. by always keeping our dreams alive. - there are places in the world that arent made out of stone. there is something inside that they cant touch. - what are you talking about -hope. - let me tell you something my friend hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. you better get used to that idea. but andy doesnt get used to that idea. he has received two things by the warden. discipline and the bible. and he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called zihujataneo. there are two things that make this movie so extremely good. the first thing is that we all can relate to andy. i must admit i didnt think much of andy first time i laid eyes on him. he had a quit way about him. a walk and a talk that just wasnt normal around here. andy is a normal guy. he is smart he is doing good. but he is not extremely strong or extremely smart or extremely rich. in other words: he is us. he is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that deep down inside us we all have: hope and determination. these two emotion are so strong and so pure that we all love to see the live of andy. that is what makes this movie so appealing. and by living just your live as best as you can by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times we see that we can inspire people. brooks was here. so was red. red didnt choose that path of brooks. red hasnt become completely institutionalized. because he lived with andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams. we the normal movie-watchers have never been to prison. and certainly there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great morgan freeman and this might be his best performance of his live. darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. there is a great soundtrack which breathes the smell of southern america into our living rooms. but im convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all. we are not stuck in a prison but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. we can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. that seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. andy learns us to never give up. to never lose faith. to always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise. i guess it comes down to a simple choice. get busy living or get busy dying.there have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. then there are some films are great because of what was written. with the shawshank redemption imdbs favorite film in works in both cases. the acting is superb and the film is incredibly well written and very justified. tim robbins plays andy dufrense a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. so he is sent to shawshank prison where he experiences lots of things. he forms a bond with redplayed terrificly by morgan freeman. the wardenplayed by bob gunton hates him. he is raped. and all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years. the shawshank redemption which is based on a shot story by stephen king is one of the most interesting films ever made. ita also one of the best films ever made too. what is one way to tell: when you hear morgan freemans narration you know youre in good hands. the acting is explosive. everyone does such a good job. the shawshank redemption is a little long but the length is tolerable. mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. morgan freeman gives the better performance of the two but the duo of robbins and freeman is once in a lifetime. the shawshank redemption was an oscar upset. it was nominated for seven including best picture best actormorgan freeman and best writing. and it lost best picture to forrest gump which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of pulp fiction also. another oscar upset. i prefer pulp fiction but the shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made. the shawshank redemption:a+  there is blood gore limbs cut off people on horses being crushed and kicked through the air by giant elephants called mumakil  you see orcs shoot a million arrows at an oncoming rohan army and when they hit the horses they flop to the ground and the riders hit it hard and are thrown  you see armies crushing other armies in waves literally  you see rocks from catapults hit and crush people in the wonderfully-made city immense destruction trolls whacking people and crushing them with their clubs and so on. there is a lot of violence i havent gotten to describe that explains the sheer immensity of this film and remember those gargoyles from the second film they call nazgul well lets just say gondorian soldiers taste good and are fun to pick up and drop from 1000 feet in the air however violence and gigantic battles is not only what makes this film great. what makes it great are the characters who you love so much the music which is some of the best i ever heard and most of all the visuals. they are very amazing and beautiful. even minas morgul the dark city of mordor is an eye-catcher. the scenery of new zealand-which is where this work of art was filmed-is just wonderful. the special effects are also some of the best ive ever seen. the oliphaunts nickname for the mumakil the giant elephants are cgi but not obviously. they are some of the most real-looking fake images ive ever witnessed the soldiers which get crushed thrown the horses that are thrown they all look real too which is what makes the battle scenes frightening they look so real the best special effect in the film however is gollum. he is also the best acted-character in the film and the best acted cgi character ever he practically is real from his emotions to his body to the hairs on his head his voice is also memorable i am trying to perfect doing it myself. he is a sight to see. the script is amazing the story is amazing everything is amazing this is one of my highest-recommended films. thank you j.r.r. tolkien for creating this wonderful story. thank you peter jackson for interpreting this wonderful story to film. and thank you all for making this possible. 10 out of 10 there arent many films that can capture you and absorb you for almost 3 hours boyhood did i went into it thinking it would be another inflated award nominated let down having heard about it for some time now and moving from excitingly wanting to see it to feeling as though the hype had taken over graciously i was wrong the characters and story whilst simple and quiet absorb you and lead you to invest in wanting to see how this normal life of a boy and family filmed for 13 years changes nothing happens? depends on the viewers perception of nothing and if its storytelling or spectacle you want i love both in films but would choose the storytelling characters and heart of boyhood over any recent films if not most films excellentthere are very few people ive met who did not like the dark knight 2008. they tend to dislike the fact that it is so rooted in reality but for me when compared with how outrageous the batman mythos can get this is a major plus that wins this film 10 out of 10 stars. lets start off with the best: heath ledger whilst different as the joker incorporates so much from the batman comics character into his performance that even though hes punk-ish and diverse in the role i totally bought him as being an updated version of the clown prince of crime. his untimely death cheated the cinema of an up-and-coming name but this is such a great legacy for him to leave behind. this is not to say that i prefer him over jack nicholson or vice versa. what nicholson did in batman 1989 was loyal and apt for that film. but this film charts dangerous characters in a dangerous world that has clearly changed since tim burtons first batman opus and nolan proves that whilst the old batman films may have been made for sheer entertainment value he is trying to convey a message to his audience. whether you buy that message or not is all a matter of interpretation. the return to chicago as the main spread of gotham city was a fantastic idea and even though i miss some of the landmarks of the previous film particularly wayne tower i accept why nolan changed pace with this sequel and hey at least the monorail makes a discreet return in some scenes here the use of locations is absolutely stunning. i am not sure if it was nolans filming style or the fact that this film did things that seemed so new in an age where everything seems to have already been done but there are plenty of memorable stunts and dialogue sequences here. unlike many i also enjoyed the character of rachel dawes and whilst i accept that katie holmes was a little inexperienced in batman begins 2005 her character wasnt used to being confronted by crooks quite as freaky as the scarecrow was she holmes replacement here by maggie gyllenhaal albeit complicating the continuity between the two films slightly seems quite appropriate. gyllenhaal is more convincing in her work with both aaron eckhart and heath ledger but i agree that she is heartless and ungrateful to christian bales batman/bruce wayne. but in many ways that adds to the poignancy of both this film and its sequel. moving along to harvey dent you may be a billy dee williams fan or a tommy lee jones person but you cannot deny that aaron eckhart gives equal consideration to both dent and his twisted alter-ego harvey two- face. in fact i think that harvey and two-face have rarely been adapted in a better way with one of the other great interpretations being two-face parts i & ii from batman: the animated series. but this is the first live-action depiction of the character/s to really come through in showing both of them although i would have liked two- face to be carried over into another sequel. but we must not sideline batman/bruce wayne must we christian bale continues to be one of the better performers to play batman but i know that his gravelly batman voice has irritated many. sure bales batman voice is sometimes difficult to understand on a first viewing and is certainly hilarious when taken in isolation or imitated on youtube but if bruce wayne didnt disguise his voice it would be even more obvious that he was batman wouldnt it michael caine again lends warmth and even more depth to his depiction of alfred pennyworth whilst morgan freeman remains charming and refreshing as lucius fox. gary oldman is given quite a wedge of the plot himself and it is interesting to see that whilst other actors to portray jim gordon were restricted in what the character could do he undertakes almost as much as the dark knight himself one other character from the previous film makes a playful and often overlooked return just after the jokers opening bank robbery but it is awesome to see that nolan didnt just shoot the scene using a stuntman. and the batmobile and its successor remain the stars of the gadgetry rolled out for this instalment especially in a chase scene that will literally knock your socks off. in the gadgets section however there is a new sonar toy that can be disorienting to audiences on the first few viewings of the film but as you get used to it its not a lot of trouble at all. hans zimmer and james newton howard deliver a tense and exciting  that showcases the jokers chaotic new theme whilst developing the themes for batman and bruce waynes personal life as introduced in the previous film. on that note even though viewing batman begins isnt essential viewing for this instalment it has surprised me how many people were unaware of it before seeing this film. its okay to miss out batman begins here but if youre intending to watch the dark knight and the dark knight rises 2012 you had best watch batman begins first as you will be very lost when it comes to understanding the final instalment anyway now that weve got all of that sorted sit back and enjoy a film that undoubtedly is a modern classic that raised the bar not only for comic book films but continues to serve as a massive inspiration in many other areas i.e. sherlock the avengers skyfall etc.  it was made for anybody who loves a great story. j.r.r tolkien knew that and so did peter jackson. and thats why the lotr trilogy is so marvellously good. there are very few films that can simply blow a human beings mind away but boythere are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. i can happily say that the shawshank redemption has stuck to me since i finished watching it for the first time and instantly rocketed up my top 10 films list. most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in shawshank at least not to me. the hefty run time doesnt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. shawshank is one of those films that i would love to experience for the first time all over again. the thrill of emotions and the highs and lows i felt that first time are incomparable to much else. in my opinion forrest gump was not as deserving of the best picture oscar as this. the timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.there are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. i have loved the shawshank redemption since i first saw it but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. in short order i lost my father to illness my wife to separation and my career to anger and dismay. lost in depression mired in pain and alone in a large house i watched it again. between brooks suffering reds hatred of hope and andys response to his final isolation i stopped feeling alone. it is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. this movie gave me the strength to start over. the movie is popular for many reasons but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own shawshank.there are no flaws in tdk. the acting the story the characters everything was absolutely amazing. the highlight of this movie is obviously heath ledger. his brutal haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie. christian bale did great as bruce wayne/batman. though the character didnt emote as much as i thought he shouldve but its not cbs fault its the writers. aaron eckhart did great in the transformation of the hero to the villain great great performance and cool effects on his face. all in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone  you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics i felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of i felt i was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied. this movie must be used as an anti-depression by therapists this movie proves that oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any oscar to the shawshank redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the oscars.. its simply over qualified there are few movies that capture and identify with the american male spirit. shawshank is one of those movies. i dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving. there are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch: shawshank redemption dancing with wolves and brave heart. unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. andy dufrane is the person in us. red is the person we want to be. aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.their are a lot of films now a days that are just so bland and uninteresting. but this film comes to none of that every second of this movie is just so fascinating from the dialoge that some characters share or just the insanity of the situations that occurs. in my opinion this film is just about how crazy life can get and quentin tarintino takes it as far as possible. the acting is great in this movie but even if this movie had terrabel acting it wouldent matter because this dialog is jut so realistic that any one can pull it off. but overall this movie just fascinates me every time i see this movie theres something new i notice about it. ill see the camera do something ive never seen before or ill learn something new about the characters i didnt know before. its a wild ride from start to finish. i adore this movie to deaththe ultimate action with a dazzling mind game incredible acting superb technology innovation with a tint of fiction makes this movie my one of the favorites. finding the goodness even after you surrounded by evil souls and losing your dear ones is what the batman gives the message. christian bale is the most deserving actor for this role and the great heath ledger rip. the dark night rises is also a great hammer on the nail but it was no match to this one. christopher nolan work will be accredited lifelong. and it is his remarkable work which has left its mark on fans heart. for all those who hadnt got the chance take time its worth it and for those who have watched it i bet you wouldnt have been got away with jokers magic.the two best things about this film are the story-telling techniques and the imagery both proving that quentin tarentino is the finest film maker of our time the story jumps around in both time and place switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts and the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpins wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home  the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban middle class house  bruce willis walking down some stairs carrying a sword wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves you dont so much watch the movie as experience itthe true masterpiece this movie has a quite way defining the life struggles deep happiness and sadness. the director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here. nothing less than a divine gift to the world. once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often. andy dufresne tim robbins and red morgan freeman both have best performances. the best ending scene of this movie i have ever scene showing kind of deja-vu and divine feeling to me. it is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. you might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. a prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid. i would say that this movie is aptly rated. this movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true hope.the trilogy of the lord of the rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... of course that dont have everything that are in the books like: -tom bombadil -barrow wights -erkenbrand -the grey company -the gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -the lords of gondor like elphir hirluin... -dol amroth and prince imrahil and their charge to help the rohirrim -battle in the shire -the scout of gondor that send the red arrow -ghan-buri-ghan and his people -sam use the ring and other things but the movies arent the book is not because of that that the movie is better or worse the movie is an adaptation not the book... my advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better : the scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this the backgrounds are amazing i think it was a great production : so my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of tolkien that make possible all this huge success... now wait for the hobbit : in short words: lotr -> epic : sy for my english portuguese here regards rodolfo fernandes costathe third installment of tolkeins masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in rotk. from the intro flashback scene to our final farewells i was literally on the edge of my seat. this film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1. my only small complaint is that i could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of legolas and gimli they felt slightly underused. all in all one of my favorite movies of all timethe third installment of the lord of the rings trilogy is by far the best of the three films. the cast of the return of the king make the 3 and a half hour film fly by in what seems like a matter of minutes. in seeing the first two films we already know that the chemistry of these actors is amazing but in the third and final installment we see the characters at the climax of their on screen performances. the relationships have grown so tight throughout the trilogy that these characters are more realistic and believable than ever. the film yet again shows us astounding visual effects and some of the best action than any other movie of 2003. this film will leave you captivated and wanting to see more and more. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is without a doubt one of the best films of 2003.the third and final installment of the lord of the rings trilogy comes to life bigger and bolder than the first two. director peter jackson and company held nothing back when it came to cgi special effects gorgeous landscapes and breathtaking cinematography. fans most familiar with tolkiens famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short as with its two prior films but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. he didnt water down the scene where frodo finally gets to mt. doom in order to get rid of the one ring once and for all_ãin fact it packs quite the punch. the way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement. the actors deserve praise as well. viggo mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is with his performance as aragorn the man who would become king of gondor. sir ian mckellen reprises his role as gandalf the white bringing the wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of tolkiens novels. elijah wood draws us in with his portrayal as frodo_ã sorrowful and weary of his travels and all of the trials hed gone through along the way. other noteworthy performances include those of liv tyler cate blanchet miranda otto dominic monaghan billy boyd hugo weaving etc. i highly recommend this film as well as its predecessors to anybody regardless of whether or not youve read the novels. of course the books are better_ãthey always are_ãbut the movies are an excellent adaptation of tolkiens wonderful tale. this film is clearly worthy of the many oscars it has won. i easily give it a 10/10.the third and final installment of the lord of the rings trilogy comes to

easily give it a 10/10.the thing really blew my mind about this movie was how the 3 dimensional 4 dimensional 5 dimensional spaces met at specific time when i heard about those dimensional spaces at first time i couldnt even imagine what it looks like but christopher nolan helped me out even though its just an one side of fiction to see i found so many knowledge of physics on this movie i was wondering if there is any other living earth or something? the answer is still not sure we dont know how 4 or 5 dimensional spaces work unless we go through in also the time difference really does make sense to me maybe someone in the other galaxy comes to us that person or something may just spend 10 minutes to get here and we may just face hundreds of year wow its truly blowing my mindthe theme to this film which is a continuation in the series and in theme from batman begins is that good versus evil is not only an external fight between a good guy and a bad guy but also is a constant battle that rages inside each and every one of us. christian bale as bruce wayne is forced to make a great deal of judgment calls based upon the circumstances being piled against him by the joker played by heath ledger. unfortunately some of the choices and actions he performs cause him to become alienated from his closest friends and ultimately the city in its entirety. but in doing so he solidifies himself as the classic tragic hero that the city loves and hates in equal measure. throughout the film harvey dent played by aaron eckhart undergoes a dramatic transformation through giving in to this darker side. he begins as what the people of gotham city refer to as the white knight due to his relentless pursuit of justice and for being a seemingly incorruptible source of good. as he is brought low by the machinations of the joker bruce is forced to sacrifice his own appearance of good to prevent dents fall from grace from completely disheartening the already injured psyche of gotham city. in keeping with the tradition of batman begins this film goes above and beyond anything i expected or hoped for. bale ledger and eckhart form an engrossing triangle that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. with equal parts action and suspense youre never left complacent. the characters are so real that you find yourself getting sucked into their world almost immediately. bale continues to make bruce wayne a believable albeit moody hero forced into making decisions that i wouldnt wish upon even my worst enemy. with a villain like the joker many myself included were worried about whether he would be convincing as a source of evil as opposed to a quirky joke of a nemesis as has been too frequently betrayed in the past through the batman franchise just watch jim carrey as the riddler in batman & robin. ledger gave a mind-blowing performance with equal parts cruelty humor and crazy. he created a persona so creepy yet brilliant youre almost always left in awe when he is on the screen. all in all a fantastic sequel that leaves the audience veritably foaming at the mouth for the next installment.the story the action the heart the lord of the rings: the return of the king has it all. no matter how many times you watch it you will get goosebumps every time. frodo and sam are getting closer to mordor with their guide gollum while the rest of middle earth prepare for the great battle of their time. other critics say that the movie uses excessive battle sequences and visual effects to fool the audience by blowing their minds. but the massive epic battles show the significance of the story. gollum tricking frodo to let sam go faramir facing inevitable death to earn his fathers love aragorn finally stepping up to become king and a loving using friendship loyalty and courage to defeat evil. not to mention howard shores masterpiece music.the story of cinderella can be traced back to early egypt china france germany and many other countries from around the world the most wellknown versions were written by charles perrault cendrillon and by the brothers grimm aschenputtel there have been countless film television and stage adaptations of the iconic story but the most wellknown adaptation is walt disneys 1950 animated film i first fell in love with walt disneys animated film when i was just threeyearsold it was actually the first disney film that i ever saw as a child i can still remember being captivated by the story and singing along with the songs it was as though a spell had been cast upon me but the magic never wore off at midnight there were no words to describe the level of excitement i had when i first found out that disney was developing a liveaction film of the timeless story tonight i had the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the upcoming liveaction version of walts most beloved animated film what i enjoyed most about the latest animation to liveaction treatment is that its a relatively straightforward telling of the iconic story while alice in wonderland and maleficent were reimaginings cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation lily james cinderella and richard madden prince charming were rightfully chosen for their iconic roles lily truly captured the true essence of cinderellas charm and beauty richard those eyes ahem was truly charming in every sense of the word i loved the chemistry between the prince and cinderella  i dont think ive seen such chemistry between two characters in a disney film for a very long time its very refreshing to see a fairy tale romance blossom cate blanchett lady tremaine and helena bonham carter fairy godmother were perfectly cast for their respective roles cate not only brought a lot of depth to her character but you could tell she was enjoying the role as the malicious stepmother helena not only brought a bit of comic relief to the film but she was definitely fun to watch  although you cant help but wonder if mrs weasley actually zapped bellatrix lestrange into a parallel universe hmm? i personally believe that disney made the right decision to hire kenneth barangh to direct the film and chris weitz to write the screenplay as i was watching the film on the big screen tonight i could tell that they both approached the story with deep understanding and most importantly respect i was genuinely relieved that it wasnt ruined by some unnecessary dark and edgy plot twist phew i absolutely loved patrick doyles  for the film and found it to be quite fitting with the story it was perfectly timed and it drew you into the fairy tale world i will definitely buy the soundtrack when its released next month sandy powells costumes though silly at times were excellent i dont think ive seen such beautiful designs in one film since the golden age of hollywood i genuinely hope sandy will be nominated for an oscar for those stunning costumes bravo the film itself is a visual marvel  especially for the fairy tale genre i was truly swept away by the lavish sets that were designed by dante ferretti i dont think ive seen such a breathtaking production since the late 1930s the special effects were equally breathtaking with the dress transformation and the carriagetopumpkin scenes being two of my favourite visual highlights im genuinely happy that disney kept the magic alive in this film very impressive my only disappointment was the running time of the theatrical cut i personally believe that it should have been 10 minutes or 15 minutes longer to flesh out the story more the film flowed smoothly and didnt feel rushed but there were a number of scenes and dialogue that were unfortunately left on the cutting room floor hopefully disney will release an extended cut or include those deleted scenes on the home media release you hear me disney? despite my issue with the running time i genuinely believe that disney did something right with their latest liveaction film while most people were probably expecting a swordwielding action hero im happy that disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect the story of cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog but managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes in the end if walt disney were alive today im sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way bravothe story as a whole is incredibly done everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. i also love how each character is so unique and well developed. so many small adjustments are made throughout the film to the characters make up for example which makes this such a well finished film. i highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. side note this is my only 10/10 film it is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. i feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made and i have many good reasons to think this. -seanthe simpler it was the better it became. the movie just showed me what i need to do in oder to become like him. thats how great the movie was. a real detective story minus the characters cape and horns. the movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story. i like the way bruce wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. this is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be. like the art of war when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. a true player of the system so he can continue with his work. the joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. when you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that heath did a great job on the joker. i remember the joker not heath. the movies theme and music became my last-song-syndrome great  by hans zimmer. the theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the story. all i can say is this is what great movies are all about.the shawshank redemption.the best movie i have seen yet.its adapted from a novel by stephen king but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.best adaptation yet to walk through in international cinema. the great camaraderie between tim robbins & morgan freeman is very difficult to surpass.wowwhat an on screen display by both of them. if robbins was fantastic then morgan was emphatic.brilliant acting by tim robbins.the best by him so far.even he would admit.morgan freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.his dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.fantastic work by him.an epitome of performance by morgan freeman.the rest of the casting is good.james whitmore as brooks is a revelationso is bob gunton as the warden. the plot is superb.ending is classy.you can never make out what happened in the end.its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.the directorial of frank darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.the dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.here are some of the best dialogs from this: andy dufresne: they say it has no memory. thats where i want to live the rest of my life. a warm place with no memory. red: let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. andy dufresne: thats the beauty of music. they cant get that from you... havent you ever felt that way about music red: we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. this movie is the epitome of all others.no movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two shawshank prisoners.must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.the shawshank redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. the movie depicts how a four lettered word hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible. though the plot of the movie focuses on how andy dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of andy dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner red. the narration by morgan freeman in the role of red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. this story proves that the king of horrors stephen king is equally good at any other genre of story writinghats off. the dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. the background  of the movie is excellent. tom robbins and morgan freeman at their best in the roles of andy dufrane and red respectively. didnt watch the movie...go grab a dvd and watch it as soon as possible. cant miss a movie like this....the shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. i first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it.the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont. it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. starring tim robbins and morgan freeman the film portrays the story of andy dufresne robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman . while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. however the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them. there was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about-and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office. however come academy award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. the rest as they say is history. for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. one thing is for sure tho is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away. its possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. but when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith. the sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. cosy prison life you say no chance. the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely and given the quite terrific performances of robbins never better & freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and red. those in support arent faring too bad either. bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton james whitmore is heart achingly great as the birdman of shawshank clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt. byron hadley william sadler amusing as heywood & mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond. then theres roger deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours. the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. thomas newmans  is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozart. if you love shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime. every viewing brings the same array of emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. above all else tho shawshank offers hopethe shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen.what makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. it is one of eternal hope. andy dufresne played by tim robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. but he never loses hope. he never gives up his quest to become a free man again. his years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. this film has a different feel to it. there has never been anything like it before and i dont know if there will again. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.the shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. similar to the green mile in many respects and better than it in almost all of them these two movies have shown us that stephen king is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. the plot is average but king did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so top-rate its almost scary. tim robbins plays andy dufrane wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. the story focuses on andys relationship with red redding morgan freeman in probably his best role and his attempts to escape from shawshank. bob gunton is positively evil and frightening as warden norton and there are great performances and cameos all aroundthe shawshank redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. the oscars biggest mistake was giving forrest gump the awards that shawshank deserved. not to take credit from forrest gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to shawshank. morgan freeman arguably delivers his best performance and tim robbins gives a performance that i feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an oscar nomination. the films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. i remember seeing the shawshank redemption on sale for $5 at wal-mart and thinking i heard this is good so i bought it. little did i know the film was worth more than gold. i bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when i was bored. i am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but the shawshank redemption changed my entire view of film. now every time i watch a movie i cant help but think it cant beat shawshank. some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong. shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of davinci and picasso. when people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. i believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one. see it now. after that imdb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. it is by the very definition of the word magnificent.the shawshank redemption is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. when i saw this movie i was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special. i also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. tim robbins andy dufresne and morgan freeman ellis boyd red redding made one of the best performances of their life. deserves to be noted that bob gunton warden norton made an also good performance. i really recommend this movie to you and i am sure that you will love it because its a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.the shawshank redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies i have ever seen. the movie is based on the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king. unlike most of his novels king didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. overseeing the transition from book to big screen is frank darabont who in his director debut s a home run with this movie. not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. tim robbins and morgan freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. bob gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. the directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesome. the plot of the movie revolves around andy dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. over time andy becomes friends with red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. the story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life. years go by but andy continues to speak of hope. ultimately andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. the message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. the climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history. overall the shawshank redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.the shawshank redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in this case brilliant. although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950s i can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards. the thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers of course] didnt use extreme clichê©s - theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey. robbins and freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actors. finally i can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies i have ever watched in my life. tim robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. also morgan freeman is really brought me the story. the story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie. this movie just gets better with every showing. theres no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. everyone must watch this movie.the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.the shawshank redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. tim robbins and morgan freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. there was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. therefore it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. a tale of two jail inmates/friends the shawshank redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. it proves that through all the troubling experiences one man never loses sight of his dream. this not only gives tim robbinss character a chance of redemption but also chance for morgan freemans character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story.the shawshank redemption is currently number one on the imdb top 250 list. i dont particularly agree with that but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. it is moving and compelling and it touches the heart and soul. the story is set in the 1940s and it involves andy dufrense tim robbins a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the shawshank prison. as one would expect he is very unhappy at first but then he leans that theres something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. as the story unfolds over the years andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates especially red morgan freeman with whom he develops a special friendship. the story isnt original or creative and its relatively simple and a bit predictable but its compelling moving and memorable and theres a bit more to it which i wont go into. the movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps experiences and emotions of the characters. tim robbins and morgan freeman put on great performances. they really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. one of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned even for life but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. the movie conveys this moral message very strongly and it truly touches the heart and soul. i am very glad i watched this movie. it is a truly emotional experience.the shawshank redemption is an uplifting deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. a passing reference to the count of monte cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling. top-notch performances exceptional cinematography and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. i love this film. its a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the pacific ocean is blue. http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com  marvelous  stupendous  phenomenal  you understand what im getting at. it is a true tale of friendship and love. its an adventure all throughout  not only for the protagonists but the viewers. the effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. each movie was released one year apart of the other and theyre all over 3 hours long. the script is great and so is the directing and everything else. there is no way this trilogy can disappoint. definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it.the shawshank redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated clichê© where theres a will theres a way. it is a monumental piece of art that can chill thrill excite and rejoice any type of audience. it renders a remarkable story of hope trust courage determination and friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant themes of corruption and police brutality. it tells a story of andy dufresne played by tim robbins a banker who is falsely accused of murdering two people. it shows andys prison life as he tries to adopt to his harsh surroundings while at the same time developing a close bond with an aging but active inmate played by morgan freeman and his comrades. as the story develops andy rises in popularity as the warden himself starts using andy for his private business. the film offers a commendable soundtrack brilliant cinematography and an astounding storyline. both tim robbins and morgan freeman are exceptional in their performances moreover bob gunton also gives a brilliant performance of the villainous warden. on the whole this film offers its viewers a kind of emotional enlightenment a kind which forces every viewer to reevaluate his stance on his life and goals. a must watch 10/10the shawshank redemption is a timeless story of heartbreak deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. the acting is superior some of tim robbins and morgan freemans best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convicts existence where i am torn emotionally between danger and safety light and shadow sanity and sorrow truth and lies injustice and justice. in fact i am lost in all the actors poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs cruel guards swindlers thieves rapists and murders all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard. in this movie i find almost no one to be all good or all bad. there are exceptions though. although there are those in charge of the prison i wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes i cheer on to win in the end. like people in real life most of the characters in the shawshank redemption both prisoners and guards those that are not miserably rotten to the bone represent many shades of gray. one of the most touching moments in the shawshank redemption is a scene in which an elderly convict who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. and his fear of this new and unnatural terrain crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping. fear can hold you prisoner. hope can set you free from the shawshank redemption. as bonds form between people of different ethnic groups economic backgrounds and intellectual levels i rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. as the story unfolds my heart hurts so hard i cry. then with tears still in my eyes i laugh the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when i was a little girl. getting older. times changing. people leaving. dying. but at the core of the main characters spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range including me a contagious hope eternal. i am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time i view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.the shawshank redemption is a story of life itself. it is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by god. i watched the movie for the first time some months ago. that evening i was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and i had to stay home. being unhappy about that i started watching the movie on the tv just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all. at first i was skeptic i admit that. but oh god at the end of it i was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 am it gave me so much emotions and so much hope i had never felt before that. i could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self. it is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. in the shawshank redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom. morgan freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. tim robbins act is just beyond perfection i bought the dvd this summer and every time i feel weak or just bad about something i watch the movie. it has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime i watch it. can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 yearsthe shawshank redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. arguably the best movie of all time. a thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. true masterpiece. there wont be another movie that can be quite anything like this. this movie is so powerful that i cant even describe this in a few words. this is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. the kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. with a storyline that not only will blow you away but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that hope is a good thing. maybe the best of things. and no good thing ever dies.the shawshank redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. after watching that movie for the first time i remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. it is beautifully written and directed. the scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when andy dufresne and ellis boyd red redding reunite at the end of the movie. this promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. even though these two men have lived in prison for years they eventually got out well andy escaped and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives each other. i recommend this movie to all ages. although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it but after several other times it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10the shawshank redemption is a movie about time patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities perhaps but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.the shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifully acted with and insbiring and uplifting message message of hope. in my opinion the film should have at least one oscar to show for its brilliance. it is truly sad that know one could see how superior shawshank is to the wearisome forest gump. i think that if shawshank had been released more recently it would have hands down won best picture it is one of the few films that are worthy of being called perfectthe shawshank redemption is a magnificent tale of friendship and hope. led by great acting all around it is a almost flawless movie. morgan freeman is at his best in this film. this has been my favorite movie since i was a teenager and i think its going to last a while. the movie as a whole is incredible but the ending is what made the movie my favorite. after watching shawshank i was unable to think for several hours. the movie put me in a trance that consisted of me just taking in what i have watched. i have never witnessed such an incredible ending to anything in the movie industry. a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie i promise it will not disappoint.the shawshank redemption is a brilliant movie with a fantastic and inspired story linebased off a short story by stephen king and a terrific and truly inspired casttheir isnt very much not to like about this movie.it is currently number one on the imdb top 250i definitely dont think it deserves to be number onethe godfather is betterbut i do think it deserves to be high up on the list.tim robbins is great in this moviebut morgan freeman is the really star.anyone who likes crime dramas and prison break movies will love this movie andy dufresne tim robbins is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is framed who killing his wife and her secret lover.he is miserable but soon makes a good friend in the wise red morgan freeman.the shawshank redemption did not win best picture because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does not need to win some sort of award top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through. this is not just a movie...its an experience that everyone need to partake in. i have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980 but this is the only movie out of all where i actually forget these are actors acting in front of a camera with a movie crew. do you know what that means --it means not only frank darabont but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. this is what every director and person who works in the film business dreams about...making a movie this groundbreaking. the shawshank redemption will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation. sometimes when i talk about this movie to people i feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. i feel like saying are you insanethe shawshank redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the usa. a wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of redmorgan freeman and andy tim robbins. andy being a banker convicted of murder and red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails. the tsr takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. the  is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. to me it is the best film of the 90s and quite possibly one of the best of all time. the fact that this film is sitting at no.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and i dont blame them. i only wish that i could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling andy and red experienced at the end. ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful. watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that frank darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10the shawshank redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films i have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. an it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as andy get one over the worden and escapes the cells to freedomthe sequel to batman begins received much hype and delivered more than what was expected.with fast-paced action an awesome plota great hero and a menacing villain.it was a battle of the brains in which the jokerheath ledgerultimately won causing batmanchristian bale to accidentally kill harvey dentaaron eckhartaka.two-face.ledger produces his memorable performance winning an oscar.also starring gary oldmanmaggie gyllenhaal. n.b not for kids -ambrose amituanai sydney australiathe second part of the trilogy of christopher nolan batman is definitely the best movie based on a superhero already made. and it has it all great characters and actors visual and sound incredible atmosphere and a dash up to all of the above. as much as you disappoint the previous installments of batman do not stop viewing the work of nolan. only the new installment of superman man of steel or the third part of the trilogy of batman can approach this huge film. finally especially mention the great performance worthy of an oscar the sadly departed heath ledger in the role of the joker which makes even forget the previous joker batman jack nicholson.the rock n roll packaging is a spoonful of sugar for this movies theme: damnation or redemption every character is either redeemed from their sins or damned for them  theyre either angels or devils or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out but who would care if pf hadnt been so well written directed produced or even acted in the first place the return of the king was possibly the most-anticipated film ever the previous two installments of the lord of the rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going publics consciousness. personally i held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. but only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after the two towers would remove this uncertainty and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. as with the fellowship of the ring i need not have concerned myself. as a spectacle the return of the king is by far the most impressive of peter jacksons landmark trilogy. unfortunately like ttt it has flaws but fortunately these are not fatal. jacksons great triumph is that even with all its cgi wonders his film does not neglect its characters in particular the relationships between gandalf and pippin eowyn and theoden and of course frodo and sam. each resonates in the memory. even in the midst of battle jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. its a shame hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle co-existing with the human element of cinema. the intercutting between the battle in front of the black gate and the desperate struggles at the crack of doom is just stunning with the expressions on the faces of the each of the fellowship members underlining what a tour-de-force of storytelling this movie is. the relationship of frodo and sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. this is the way it should be because their parting at the grey havens is the last act of the story. jackson shows that his sensitivity to tolkien is still there in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. ironically the clamour of too many endings by those who hadnt read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made. a lot of story had to go into this movie but this is necessary for the following reasons. in ttt there is a convenient pause in the story between helms deep and the isengard reunion. after pippin looks into the palantir the momentum is unbroken in the fotr movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside minas tirith. thus a great deal of ttt book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of ttt left out many of the last chapters. there was no place for the voice of saruman chapter at the end of ttt because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic but more about that later. also jackson really has no option but to put frodos and sams fights with shelob and the battles for gondor at the same stage of the movie. this makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension then the shelob fight then another tension buildup before the great battle for gondor. the structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. anyway when tolkiens chronology in the appendices is read you realise both events happen at nearly the same time. the worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of denethor. he is totally unsympathetic which is a mistake because in the book he is much more interesting. jackson should have found a way to include denethors struggle with sauron through the palantir because this is the real reason for denethors madness. in this film the cause is his grief over boromirs death which also partly explains his treatment of faramir but this sells the character of denethor short. not only that but also the death of denethor is perhaps jacksons worst error of judgement. the fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous. there is nothing wrong with the arrival of the army of the dead to win the battle but its just not as stirring as the end of helms deep battle. the high point of rotks battles is the charge of the rohirrim and their fight against the mumakil ie giant elephants which tends to make the actual of end of the battle a let down. wisely jackson does not focus on the green tide washing over saurons hordes instead he cuts back to miranda ottos wonderfully passionate portrayal of eowyn killing the witch-king then throws in the now-famous single-handed bringing down of a mumakil by who else legolas of course. no discussion of this movie should neglect the extended edition dvd. possibly the greatest flaw in the theatrical version of rotk is the omission of the voice of saruman scene and insertion of a silly misleading line of gandalf that saruman had lost his power. but unfortunately as with the omission of the sons of denethor scene at osgiliath in ttt the scene breaks the flow of the movie too much and given the three hour plus running time this decision was understandable. as with ttt jackson is given a get out of jail card by the ee on which sarumans demise can be seen for the first time. i am sorry to say that i was not as generally impressed by the rotk ee as i was by the ees of fotr and ttt. jackson is too self-indulgent with gimlis character. in the theatrical version of rotk i didnt mind these gags but in the paths of the dead scene in particular i found that gimlis antics spoiled the mood of horror and dread that should have been maintained. all of that being said the ee still deserves the highest recommendation. it adds many important details such as eowyn and faramir falling in love. the lotr movie experience is incomplete without it.the return of the king is the third and final film in the lord of the rings saga. peter jacksons portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. rotk is an epic tale of sacrifice courage and friendship. frodo and sams journey to mount doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. elijah woods once again portrays frodo wonderfully as well as sean astin. the rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes especially viggo mortenson and ian mckellan as gandalf. visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. this has been a long journey of film starting with the fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.the return of the king is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the lord of the rings trilogy. this one is the best. aragorn takes the lead role this time as he faces his destiny to become the king of gondor. gollum motion-captured andy serkis is becoming a big problem for sam sean astin as frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than sam himself. and pippin billy boyd pledges his allegiance to denethor john noble the crabby and evil stand-in leader of gondor. denethor doesnt have the best attitude in the world such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. the ending is very long but it isnt bad. the entire movie is riveting magical cinema and i ate up every minute of it. the return of the king is a masterpiece and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt more than that actually. 4/4the return of the king is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. this movie deserved the eleven oscars it got including the editing. without the editing this movie wouldve been over four hours long. even though this movie is about three and a half hours it dies not feel like it. the scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. gollum is the show-stealer again. as the ring is taking frodo away from strength gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive sam away. it was kind of sad to see gollum die along with the ring in the fires of mt.doom. aragorn deserves to be king of gondor. he was amazing in this movieplayed by viggo mortensen. i am glad that legolas and gimli were used for comedy. with all the drama and action there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. the acting is perfect. i liked most of the characters. it was sad when theoden died. he was great in this series. the music by howard shore is even better. you can hear some celtic tunes during some scenes. i loved the song into the west by annie lennox. the effects and the cgi is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. peter jackson really put his name into the record books. this is the best fantasy epic in fact the best movie of all time. i rate this movie 15/10if the rating system went any higher.the return of the king is my favorite movie. it concludes a marvelous trilogy directed by the genie peter jackson  this last opus has absolutely everything a spectator can dream of: incredible special effects that even in 50 years wont seem outdated actors that believe in the story they are telling us if you check the dvds bonus youll see how all actors were deeply attached to their characters music that will lift you up to the clouds a story certainly inspired by tolkiens books but still really catchy but in another hand jackson edited the books to make movies even more interesting and i could go on and on and on ... congratulations to all the ones that have contributed to the making of this film the return of the king is a film full of ambition. that is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. the scope and scale of this film was enormous i do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one and im not sure there will ever be another. though not only is return of the king a true epic through and through it also has a ton of drama. this film has so much emotional resonance and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. when sam picks frodo up and carries him up the slope of mount doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. this film is not only a terrific actioner but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. when it is over there is no denying that the return of the king is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. i give the return of the king a perfect 10 out of 10the plot is simple but hard to explain it is basically a story telling the intertwining lives of two mob hit men a gangster a gangsters wife a boxer and two robbers this film has a fantastic cast from john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis uma thurman tim roth amanda plummer and ving rhames i think i missed someone out but yeah its a pretty good cast they deliver their lines so naturallythe perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. do not try to compare the first or the second movie with this you must see it as a 10 hours movie. sorry there is no lord of the rings next year...damm  the film is just a big crazy amusement park. most important to me though and im sure many others would have to be the storys structure. have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film its crazy. its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore. it wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an a to b. the way quentin tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. the film just flows. the transitions are so fluid. and the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. vincent jules and butch are really just normal people in the world of pulp fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life. not only do vincent and jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry vincent and butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. the conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. jules though jules is excellent. a great character played by a great actor. samuel l jackson steals every single scene hes in. his monologues are legendary. this man must have needed some great vengeance and furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. he was one bad mother. i remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. i thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be. looking back i think i was right. the path of the rigtheous man... when you hear this im sure you still get the chills. the best 90s movie because of the plot because of the changes that tarantino made in the perception of time in films. because of the astonishing performances of everyone in the cast. because of the soundtrack... a movie that nobody will ever forget.the opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film. an eerie  brilliant directing and spot on acting. there isnt too much that i feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away. i will tell you that the joker is incredible. the trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of heath ledgers incredible acting so i recommend seeing it for yourself. a lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder. go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films.the muchanticipated interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions both on film and in

of my film rants follow me on twitter calcium_wastethe movies does a solid job of defying reality by fiction and engaging people with such perfection that a pure super-heroic fiction film gets more than just fiction. the directions so perfect action so realistic performances like never seen before music to die for  awesome cinematography omg its superb. the dialouges feels so crafted and well defined and the joker is flawless. chris has done a brilliant job  and the whole cast is brilliant. with the usual real world scenarios and talksit shows the unexcepted and awesomely scripted every scene that you wont get bored even if you are a not so die-hard batman fan or something. marvel superheroes those lame iron man and thor should learn from this  not forced like so many other actors. tim robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion which seems to resonate in his eyes. the genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold as the story lays itself out like a poster of rita hayworth. to say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live love experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. it makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day but never truly see. to describe this movie as great would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. while it is brutal and realistic it portrays humanity at our best and our worst providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. by the time the credits roll were left speechless...and at the same time wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish. everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way i guess a picture really is worth a thousand words...... the movie was spectacular. the trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. it was unbelievably impressive. starting with the movie once again the acting was phenomenal. the emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. its amazing at how a movie can be four hours long yet not feel as if it was more than three or two and a half. the visual effects are incredible. the trilogy as a whole is unbelievablethe movie was great and the acting of christian bale was out of this world.i think he is the best actor of present era. the story line of movie was great. the only shortcoming that i see is when they attack the city and the scenery they show of city is not very good  very suffocating. beside this the movie was great.the movie has live up to the expectation. the message given in the film is very good. i want to salute the guy who have written the dialog of this batman movie series. the dialogue are just amazing and their delivery is killing. you want to hear the dialogs again and again . believe me. the gadgets of the batman are amazing. i specially like to talk about the caretaker of wayne house. mr. pennyworth he has done his role very effectively. in the nutshell  the movie is great and totally worth your money.the movie was directed by quentin tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of hollywood cinema it was released on 14th october 1995 and maintains its position #5 in imdbs top 250 list ever since the great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested it revolves around the lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption the thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by samuel l jackson john travolta and uma thurman this movie has some great all time favorite dialog like i dare you i double dare you and many more the music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested coming to the composition of the movie the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed the movie starts from present goes into the past then jumps to future and comes back to the present this is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused coming to awards and nominations it won an oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture best actor best actor in the supporting role best director and many more overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an oscar which is a sign of great movie so i would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plotacting and direction and one should watch it at least oncethe movie that shot director quentin tarantino into popularity pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created the film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: samuel l jackson and john trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase uma thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with trovolta bruce willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters ands tim roth and amanda plummer play a couple robbing a diner the plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting the film features most tarantino trademarks including his normal chunky dialogue with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here the films also not shy on action and theres loads of surprises throughout the moviealthough i wont spoil anything acting wise pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man while trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss the supporting cast is strong with harvey keitel playing the gangster expert and even tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role but thats not the only reason pf is so great its everything about it the soundtrack is classic tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story while the camera work is some of the best since the films release and the film just keeps on giving from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie to its hilarious middle acts to its hugely satisfying conclusion as it stands pulp fiction is still one of the funniest darkest most enjoyable and most creative films ever if you havent seen the film yet then i cant recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can a true classicthe movie is one of my favorite movie. it was unfortunate that i didnt see it in the big screenthe movie is all what i expect and imagine from the book excellent effects actors direction photography is amazing..the music... i have no words... the movie has a amazing develop from the first movie so this is the most involving but the end although the length is ... well.. from usa today: the three-part story of courage friendship honor and duty _ã spanning the fellowship of the ring 2001 the two towers 2002 and the return of the king which comes to theaters tonight _ã is ideally suited to epic film-making. it is steeped in fast-paced action and grand adventure yet still grounded in humanity _ã a rare combination among large-scale film extravaganzas. it isnt until now that director peter jacksons efforts can be fully and fairly judged notwithstanding the monumental box office success of the first two films which have grossed $1.8 billion worldwide. as good as each individual movie is the third film vaults the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. key characters are enhanced new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely while feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly. after the release of the first and second films one wondered how the trilogy as a nine-hour film fest might compare with other cinematic watermarks. in its entirety the lord of the rings surpasses other multi-part sagas such as star wars or even the godfather. both star wars and the godfather had weak links whole movies that didnt work as well as the best of the series. rings maintains the same standard of excellence with each film and grows more assured with each installment. of course some of that escalating power is attributable to the storytelling prowess of j.r.r. tolkien upon whose classic novels the trilogy is based. the books depict the odyssey of the humble hobbit frodo whose quest is to destroy a powerful ring that could enslave all the inhabitants of the fictional land of middle-earth. helping him accomplish his mission is a heroic cadre of creatures: gandalf the wizardthe movie is absolutely perfect. outstandingly acted and perfectly directed by chris nolan. the movies only wrong is the fact that the character of harvey dent/two face isnt given enough time to develop his psychological state. heath ledger steals the show and stands out as the best actor in the bunch. the movie gets better and better every time i watch it. it not only surpasses batman begins - previously considered the high-water mark of movies about the dark knight - but one that magnificently transcends the superhero genre. even if this wasnt ledgers final role before his untimely death last year his joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time. lets put a smile on that face.the movie is about the fall of two heroes - gothams unofficial hero and gothams real hero. im talking about the dark knight and harvey dent. this amazing movie shows how easy its to fall to the dark side what harvey dent did. aaron eckhart is great in this role and heath ledger really shows what acting is.i really love heath ledger for his portrayal of the joker his best role. but unfortunately he past away and he got a oscar post-morten. the question if he really deserved the academy award is hard to answer he had a lot of really amazing competitors. im afraid to say too much in this review so my best tip is to buy it on blu-ray or dvd and watch it i promise you youll love it.the movie gone girl is about a man named nick dunne whose wife amy is missing on their fifth wedding anniversary then a while later they suspect that nick dunne killed his wife the movie is excellent and oscar worthy especially for rosamund pike and david fincher the movie is the best thriller of all time in my opinion it grabs your attention thanks to screenwriter and author gilliam flynn the movie has a great cast with a brilliant story that is suspenseful the theme of the movie is dark and creepy to intense more people throughout the movie this movie should be number 1 of the top 250 movies of all time it at least needs to get to 9510the movie experience of the decade for me comes via pulp fiction when it opened on opening day to little fanfare or hype i asked my friends if theyd want to go none did so i went by myself and had the most spiritual film experience of my life thus far im 24 electric sharp masterfully crafted and an incredible screenplay only tap the beginning as to how i feel about this masterpiece pulp fiction is why god created filmthe movie begins with batman and lt. jim gordon closing in on the organized crime groups and leaders. in gotham the gangs are united because of the presence of batman. he put tracers on the money of the gangs to see its flow so that it will be easier to catch the leaders. these gangs have a chinese national as their accountant and money launderer. he takes all of their money out of the banks to keep the money safe before the police get it. this plan works well because the police went to the banks and the money was gone. their accountant lou also left the country to avoid any charges against him. then the joker crashes the gangs meeting offering to kill batman for half of their money. all the leaders said that the joker was ridiculous but once batman brought lou from china to the police the leaders gave the joker access to all the man and utilities. the joker wages war against batman by trying to lure out the man under the mask by killing innocent people. the batman was ready to come out in a conference when suddenly the new district attorney harvey dent said he was batman. the joker then tried to kill dent but the batman hid him. in the aftermath the joker took dents girlfriend rachel who happens to be batmans ex-girlfriend and threw her out a window. this exposed the batmans weakness for rachel because he jumped out after her. the joker then takes dent and rachel and on opposite sides of the city and puts them in a room full of explosive with enough time for batman to save one. the batman decides to go after dent who burns half of his face in the explosion which means rachel died. dent was furious with the batman and started to hate the world. the joker paid him a visit in the hospital and convinced him to blame the world. the batman captures the joker and is called to assist lt. gordon in saving his family from harvey dent. while saving the son of gordon batman kills dent. he decides to take all the blame on himself to keep hope in the city. the joker makes the dark knight a must watch film because he becomes the greatest villain of all time. joker is a great super villain because he has no motive for his actions. in the opening scene you can see that the joker is a mastermind. he plans a bank robbery second by second and in this job he kills all of the robbers that he hired to be left with all the money. some argue that this is contradictory later in the movie where he burns money to show he does not care about the money. in reality the joker planned this job to show the police that there is a new villain in gotham. the joker wants batman to kill him knowing that the batman will not kill because justice will not be done. the joker draws focus on the batman throughout the movie but in the end the unpredicted happens. the joker shows batman that his plan was to turn dent the notorious new district attorney being praised as the white knight into a villain. the joker does not want fame money or revenge. he simply wants to show the world that all people have their dark side but they chose to be good. the joker knows exactly what to say to trigger people to react in a fit of rage and he knows exactly how to react in that situation. a villain should be terrifying in every scene and the joker is a prime example of this. when he walks in on all of the gangs leaders meeting and is approached with opposition he opens his jacket to reveal about 6 grenades wired. he does not care about his life let alone anybody others. one of the most memorable qualities about the joker is his scars. in the movie we never learn how he actually received them. every time he brings up the scars the reasoning changes to apply to the person but later he ends up scarring the people to match him. heath ledger picked up a habit of flicking his tongue while trying to figure out the best was to portray the joker and the little tongue flip in between the sentences make him seem creepier and builds suspense. at one scene the joker is in the middle of the road crippled with the batman speeding violently straight at the joker. the jokers reaction is surprising instead of trying to avoid the batman he stands and is calling for batman to kill him. i can picture that scene now the joker chanting and later screaming come on. come on. i want you to do it. come on hit me hit me that scene shows that the joker is fearless which in return makes him unpredictable and suspenseful. a villain that is asking for death knowing that if batman kills him that batman will become a vigilante. in conclusion the joker is successful in flipping the one time unstoppable incorruptible district attorney harvey dent into a villain. this causes batman to choose to let all of the peoples hopes and dreams of a brighter future die with dent or should the story be flipped turning the batman into the cities most hated man. the jokers success in making the batman have to go into hiding means that he accomplished what he wanted which makes him the greatest villain. heath ledgers role as the joker won 32 best supporting character awards. ledgers acting and presentation of the joker is unmatched. the joker became the greatest villain of all time in the dark knight.the most fantastic movie ive seen its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now a must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art i have watched this movie tons of times and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant also reservoir of dogs is very recommended one of my most favorite movies of all i am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasnt yet trashed hollywood have fun watching and happy journeythe most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit they look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited the movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way those robots there are amazing as well complete opposite of marvin from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i love them the emotional layer is as great as it gets you may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible it all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the universe encountering strangest parts of physicsthe more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it. an absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. if you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. i have watched it for many times at least ten times i guess. now i hope i can download it and keep it and enjoy it once i have time. i used it to encourage people around me for example a girl friend whos suffering from the depression a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet and a friend who lost his job recently.the lord of the rings: the return of the king was an amazing third part of the lord of the rings trilogy. it was good to show the prologue on how smeagol/gollum got the ring. so it was shown that he murdered his own cousin deagol. through this we can all understand on how gollum exactly got the ring. if it hadnt for the prologue we could have just thought that gollum got it by himself. but no what happened was deagol got it first and stolen by smeagol by killing deagol. the effects made in the three hunters visit to the dimholt road where the ghosts who will answer to the king of gondor is found is wonderful. it was never seen clearly as digitally edited but more life-like. in the battle of pelennor fields it was an amazing scene where thousands of orcs were made through massive a software intended to create multiples of characters. the rohan scenery was great theoden s screenplay during that time was most impressively appropriate for their situation. eowyn also even as a woman acted great by miranda otto in taking down the oliphaunt. i really loved her style. in the part where legolas was told by aragorn to take down the oliphaunt. i love how legolas acted by orlando bloom in that scene. i do not know whether it was digitally edited of his jumping or it was his own stunt. but however it was done it was amazing and stylish in the front of the black gate scene i have seen the extended edition of rotk and the mouth of sauron was exclusively shown. i could have wanted it to be part of the movie but i understand that the movie is rate pg-13 and is needed not to show to much brutality. the part where sam was going to help frodo out i understood that the ring was still tempting frodo. have any of you realized that the ring didnt break out easily it was because it wanted frodo to come after it and save it. but frodo realized to climb up with the help of sam and that was the time that the ring broke because it knew that it will be destroyed once frodo turns his back on it. i love how they interpreted the rings desire into the movie though some may not see it that way. the part where frodo was going to leave for valinor i was sad that part. i even thought to myself why would frodo go but when he said to sam we set out to save the shire sam and it has been saved but not for me. so i realized that frodo as a hero did it not for himself but for his beloved home. the movie was incredibly awesomely greatly amazingly wonderfully beautifully made the crew and cast really made tolkiens work come to life go lotr: rotkthe lord of the rings: the return of the king is the concluding chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy and i must say it concluded amazingly. the movie starts off with a dark backstory of smeagol which when i say dark i mean dark. you see smeagol murder his friend deagol or lover in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison mens minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. from here you see smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as gollum and its just a really dark segment but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. i must mention that there is one character in this movie that i despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: denethor boromirs father who pretty much scorns his second born son faramir. its obvious that faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time but when denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of boromir you cant as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as faramir. i mean imagine your father said that to you  so gandalf took pippin and rode to minas tirith. meanwhile on the road to the ships that will take elves away from middle earth arwen was thinking over her choice of path. until has a vision of her son that convince her to go home. so she rode home and plead her father to reforge the ancient blade of narsil and give it to her beloved aragorn so he can become the king he was born to be. so overall all three films are excellent. and you know i do feel sorry for faramir being an the unappreciated son i mean it was his big brother boromir who was their dads favorite. i love the developing friendship between merry & eowyn. and i love the end-title song performed by annie lennox. the lord of the rings: the return of the king in my view has to be one of the best if not the bestconclusions to any trilogy in movie making history. when i first heard that peter jackson had begun filming the lotr films i was a little apprehensive as id not long finished reading the books. i thought there was no way hed be able to do them justice and that the films would go the same way as many trilogys had gone before by starting on a high but sadly lacking at the end. my apprehension however was not needed. the return of the king stayed more or less quite true to the books. the size and scale of the battles is immense and the sets scenery and cgis are thoroughly stunning.i cant wait until the extended version comes out on dvd so as to see the bits that had to be omitted due to time constraints. peter jackson can now sit among the big boys of direction and i only hope that if he gets the go ahead for the hobbit it will be made in the same style and panache as the lotr trilogy. i would recommend lord of the rings: return of the king to anyonethe lord of the rings: the return of the king concludes the journey of frodo sam and gollum to the fires of mordor. but while they proceed to mordor gollum has a nasty plan to get back at frodo for supposedly betraying him. and while this is happening pippin merry gandalf aragorn legolas gimli and the rest of the kingdom of rohan learn of saurons plan: to attack the kingdom of gondor for he knows that the heir of isildur aragorn has come back. so begins one of the biggest battles you will see on the screen. i must say this is a great way to end the series. yes its over 3 hours long but its still very good. and this is a film not a movie. a film. there is also much more emotion than in the other ones and you see the deterioration of frodo as the ring takes hold of him. please see this movie because if you think you thought that the first two were damn good you aint seen nothing yet.the lord of the rings: the return of the king brings peter jacksons mammoth adaptation of j.r.r. tolkiens classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by peter jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of j. r. r. tolkiens the lord of the rings. it is the concluding film in the lord of the rings film trilogy following the fellowship of the ring and the two towers. as sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of middle-earth gandalf the wizard and thê©oden king of rohan rally their forces to help defend gondors capital minas tirith from the looming threat. aragorn finally claims the throne of gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat sauron. ultimately even with full strength of arms they realise they cannot winthe lord of the rings: return of the king is the third and final installment of peter jacksons adaptations of tolkiens famous fantasy novels. once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes sets scenery models cgi effects and howard shores epic  to create a convincing depiction of middle earth. once again the cast delivers expert performances. john noble joins the cast as denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. bernard hill once again brings authority to the role of king theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. miranda otto brings strength to the role of eowyn and makes the characters best moments unforgettable. ian mckellen once again brought his commanding presence as gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together. this film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking tolkiens work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. the famous battle at minas tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. as with the first two films i found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting but they didnt add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.the lord of the rings: return of the king is a striking powerful and beautiful film with an amazing storyline. this is the final journey for the fellowship of the ring to complete their mission through battle passion and love. i believe in this film this is where the true relationships of the characters start to form and become strong and meaningful. without spoiling the film for you i will now talk about the soundtrack. for me the soundtrack is at the heart of this film. it is filled with so much emotion i even get teary when listening to it. a brilliant soundtrack along with an amazing story means you get an excellent film. i definitely recommend everyone to watch this although this film requires full concentration so perhaps only watch it when you have time to get the best experience.the lord of the rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken. it has been a privilege to see all the 3 movies almost impeccably true to the spirit of the book. it is with great anticipation that i look forward to the hobbit to be made in new zealand and know that sir ian mckellan is looking forward to spending a year there reprising his role as gandalfhe has just said so - 20 minutes ago on bbc news. im sure it will be made with the same dedication to detail that marked the sequel lotr.it will be made more enjoyable now i have a large screen with which to view the spectacular scenery of new zealand once again.the lord of the rings trilogy made by peter jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film but also the story was magical captivating and unforgettable with great characters excellent performances and beautiful music. this was one of the most incredible films ever made i think those three lord of the rings flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was avatar from james cameron. the return of the king is the excellent third and lastpart of this great trilogy and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. this movie was excellent from beginning to end being epic emotional and thrilling. the battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: the ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made. this movie is magnificent and it is one of the best flicks ever made.the lord of the rings trilogy are the three greatest films ever madethe lord of the rings the return of the king is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. there is romance between sam and rosie and aragorn and arwen who almost could not be together because of the war and faramir and eowyn. there is loads of comedy specifically speaking of merry and pippin but also between gimli and legolas when in the fight scenes. my favorite quote of gimlis is always: certainty of death small chance of success what are we waiting for i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. another scene is when legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt with many men in his way and gimli still manages to keep that as one: that still only counts as one this movie is of course action packed. thousands of blood-thirsty orcs completely built for killing march to the gates of minas tirith. after a few blows from the gondor catapults throwing chunks of the city the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails aragorn gimli and legolas come to the rescue. of course they couldnt do it alone the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask a dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with aragorn to assure their own freedom. the true meaning of the movie however is friendship. in the darkest times of middle earth 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other or their own friendship. it seems as though the only hope in the world which they were lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring and each other frodo baggins and sam gamgee finally save middle earth and rid the world of its evil inhabitants just by keeping hope in front of them and holding on to each other. basically their faith in each other and their friendship saved all of middle earth. i hope that you enjoy this movie as much as i did.the lord of the rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. how peter jackson pulled it off i will never know maybe he used one of gandalfs enchantments rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. from the writing to the production crew to the acting to the sceneryto the music oh god i love the musicand just everybodys determination to pull this near impossible feat off even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. peter jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune viggo mortensens last minute replacement says it all it was as if the spirit of tolkien himself was guiding it along. as i see this as one whole movie i wont be reviewing just the return of the king. i saw the first film the fellowhip of the ring when i was 12 and im 21 now and i still havent been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and i doubt i ever will. the transition from the innocence and lightness of the shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. i think fellowship is my favourite of the three it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. the whole mines of moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. to the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog it is exhilarating involving and most of all - emotional. the two towers has the hardest task of being the middle film but it more than rises to the challenge. it drops you straight into the action and doesnt hold up. the rohan sequences are the best bits of the film culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. the creation of gollum was revolutionary through cgi and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real. the return of the king delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. i remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. there are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one i will mention is the charge of the rohirrim. this scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. i was so happy when this film won 11 oscars it more than deserved it i was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well. any gripes i have for the trilogy would be the portrayal of its big bad sauron and considering that sauron is the centre of the lord of the rings this is definitely a problem. if there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely sauron. how do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are are so vague and surreal is sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form this is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film where the audience needs to see their villain. peter jackson and co do the best they can with the material and chose to literally portray sauron as the big flaming eye. however this is not enough to satisfy especially during the climax of return of the king where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse the films make the mistake of bigging sauron up through the films and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame. as you can tell from what i have said i love the lord of the rings and i would say it is my favourite film of all time. no other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear to sadness to laughter. i honestly couldnt imagine anyone else playing the characters it was if they were made for them. the actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with peter jackson just watch the extras and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. it was almost to the point that the actors werent working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to mr.jackson. hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. honourable mentions will be given to ian mckellen as gandalf viggo mortensen as aragorn and elijah wood as frodo i felt these three literally became the characters they were playing but of course there are countless others to mention but i dont have time. howard shores  is possibly the best movie  ever and the films would be nothing without it. ultimately say what you will hardcore tolkien fans about the films you cannot deny that they did so much for tolkiens greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. if you have somehow not seen these films first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially the return of the king which had many vital scenes cut aka. sarumans last hoorah and gandalf confronting the witch king. peter jackson i salute you and new zealandthe lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english philologist and university of oxford professor j. r. r. tolkien. the story began as a sequel to tolkiens 1937 childrens fantasy novel the hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work. it was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 much of it during world war ii. it is the second best-selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies sold. the title of the novel refers to the storys main antagonist the dark lord sauronwho had in an earlier age created the one ring to rule the other rings of power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of middle-earth. from quiet beginnings in the shire a hobbit land not unlike the english countryside the story ranges across northwest middle-earth following the course of the war of the ring through the eyes of its characters the hobbits frodo baggins samwise sam gamgee meriadoc merry brandybuck and peregrin pippin took but also the hobbits chief allies and traveling companions: the men aragorn a ranger of the north and boromir a captain of gondorthe lord of the rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. not even just a visual experience. peter jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into the quintessential epic. he supplements the brilliant storytelling of jrr tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created t is one of the masterpieces delivered by the legendary director peter jackson.the film takes us to the final part of the journey of the hobbit master frodo baggins and his friend samwise gamgee to the rough and dry evil land of mordor to the mount doom to destroy the ring made by the evil lord sauron.this movie completely grasps you and amazes you alongwith inspiring you and giving a simple yet important message that with courage you can achieve anything as was done by frodo and thus disproving the phrase nobody simply walks into mordor.legendary actor sir ian mckellen completely justified the with the role of gandalf.elijah wood as frodo baggins and viggo mortensen as aragorn has delivered the performances of their lives. as a film though this is amazing. a true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinemathe lord of the rings ... best trilogy and movie ever made. the cast as they have been all the way are excellent. woods frodo changes well during this film while astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. bloom and rhys-davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch that still counts as one being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension. mortensen is the title character and serves it well with mckellen also continuing his strong role. i could list through the whole cast but i will stick with noting two things. firstly both monaghan and boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. secondly i continue with my belief from the second film that serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. his gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic fearsome hateful and funny. praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character as opposed the look is foolish. he deserved one for two towers so i hope an oscar goes his way. it was a shame to not have screen time for lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.the lord of the rings - the two towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping lord of the rings saga of films by peter jackson. it is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the lord of the rings franchise. the first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on but part two has just as much action. id rank them: part 3 then part 2 then part 1 in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film. my only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three.the longest movie ever made so long that the director had to divide it in three parts and thats why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end. in the fellowship of the ring we start with the journey of frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin towards to mordor lair of the dark lord sauron. and we see the great training and union of the fellowship of the ring an alliance of all the living beings of middle-earth on a mission to destroy the one ring and thus save the world from the darkness. in two towers we have the beginning of the great war between humans and orcs with the army of saruman christopher lee marching against the kingdom of rohan. and aragorn viggo mortensen along with the elf legolas orlando bloom and the dwarf gimli john rhys-davies joining in the battle. meanwhile frodo and sam are getting closer every day to the lair of sauron now having the help of the strange creature gollum / smeagol andy serkis who wants by all means his precious. and finally in the return of the king we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. frodo and sam finally reached mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and gollum / smeagol plans to take the ring from frodo who becomes increasingly heavy. and on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending. peter jackson director-writer brought to life the masterpiece of books lord of the rings by the genius jrr tolkien. this can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. the gigantic story that was told in six books in film it was told in one film. a film of more than 10 hours it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. i say its just a movie because all three movies work as one from the beginning to the end we realize that. since the first film or first part we have the magic of tolkiens working here along with jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens writers have recreated and remained faithful to tolkiens work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection. not only the writing is phenomenal but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. and the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent. a trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. a landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast the lord of the rings is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all. 10/10the lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption pulp fiction is known for its high praise highly praised as one of the best movies of all time funny thing is: the movie is pointless and it has no message this is where it all falls in place the acting is top notch  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy the style was very familiar if you have seen quentins earlier work i found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way pulp fiction though has no message and executes it nicely its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness this is what i wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish pulp fiction these facts combine to the fact that pulp fiction is one of my favorite films it has no point  but the fact that is has no point puts it up there with the greatest i had no expectations beforehand but afterword i had so much to praise the entertainment the humor and the point lying before yes it has a point but it is too obscured to find out the real meaning i love this movie and im sure you will too dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise the surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film pulp fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment this is by far quentins best film 10/10  the last part of the lord of the rings trilogy was even better than the excellent two first movies. positive:fantastic actionemotional depththe feeling of closureloyal to the bookexcellent cgi negative-nothing this movie is in my considerate opinion one of the best movies i have ever seen and concludes a brilliantamazing-awesome trilogy.congratulations to persy jackson and all the cast.well deserved the oscars.best movie 2003.no doubt about that.i think that tolkien would be proud. gandalf and aragorn lead the world of men against saurons army to draw his gaze from frodo and sam as they approach mount doom with the one ring.the joker is the main attraction of this movie. this character was simply brilliant. everything went according to plan and this is one of the most faultless characters you will ever see. before ledger was confirmed to play the joker in july 2006 paul bettanylachy hulmeadrien brodysteve carelland robin williams expressed their interest in the role. however nolan preferred ledger for his chaotic interpretation of the character. ledger was also interested in doing a film having high expectation. he described his joker as a psychopathic mass murdering schizophrenic clown with zero empathy. throughout the film the joker states his desire to upset social order through crime and comes to define himself by his conflict with batman. to prepare for the role ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month formulating the characters posture voice and personality and kept a diary in which he recorded the jokers thoughts and feelings. ledger eventually generated a voice unlike jack nicholsons character in tim burtons 1989 batman film. theres a bit of everything in him. theres nothing that consistent ledger said. ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the joker sends out as warnings. each take ledger made was different from the last. nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot. ledgers acting was so lively that most people will agree that this is the best villain character ever. even when it comes to the best acting performance of all time joker should be in the top three. his character was so touching and enthusiastic that people will want to be the joker rather than becoming batman if they have a choice. this character had a deep impact in viewers mind. on january 22 2008 after he had completed filming the dark knight ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. it was tremendously emotional right when he passed having to go back in and look at him every day nolan recalled. but the truth is i feel very lucky to have something productive to do to have a performance that he was very very proud of and that he had entrusted to me to finish. all of ledgers scenes appear as he completed them in the filmingthe joker clowns makeup more sloppy than before his cackle betraying deep wounds he seeks revenge he claims for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. in one diabolical scheme near the end of the film he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. throughout the film he devises ingenious situations that force batman commissioner gordon and district attorney harvey dent to make impossible ethical decisions. by the end the whole moral foundation of the batman legend is threatenedthe intelligent cut from the editor sally menke working with the master quentin tarantino has just made a movie worth watching over and over to enjoy each particular scene a tribute to everyone who likes movies and good music a puzzle just possible to be done by watching more than once in order to memorize those amazing quotes quotes like i do believe marsellus wallace my husband your boss told you to take me out and do whatever i wanted. now i want to dance i want to win. i want that trophy so dance good. a scene that makes us travel in time to gold ed sullivans time or to grease great lines that just tarantinos at his best could deliver tomato joke hamburgers 5 dollar shake watch hidden in the ass sword and memorable characters surely my top 10 best movies ever made.the hobbits approach the slopes of mount doom preparing to dispose of the cursed ring while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. the film won the academy award for best picture the only time in history a fantasy film has done so. the return of the king is the longest of the three films which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other like jet planes waiting to land the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. most audiences will forgive peter jackson for that for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subjectthe hobbit movies are better. but it is still all the middle earth movies are good. this movie as a great story line. it is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. it has great acting. great special effects. great visual effects. great movie see it. it has a lot of action. it is long but so fast past that you will not notes. you could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. this is a great movie. one of the beast fantasy movie ever made. it is so cool. see all the middle earth movies they are awesome. great movie great movie great movie great movie. see it see it see it see it see it see it see it. some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.the highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the late heath ledger...his oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him but christopher nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the filmthe greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. this reminds me of viktor frankls book mans search for meaning based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. it is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. the only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces and in that creative expression one finds meaning. no one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom _ã_ its source is within and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. all institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead confine individuals so that they become institutionalized. the prison is the toughest of all institutions. but the tougher the conditions the greater is the challenge and if understood that way the greater the rewards in finding meaning. but until that is accomplished one must have something essential and substantial to believe in _ã_ call it hope or faith or self esteem _ã_ in order to survive for nothing is accomplished in death. at the same time the idea of death itself is the motivating force _ã_ a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself _ã_ this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence something that was hinted at in joseph hellers catch 22. at the centre of this catch is the hope a word much abused that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire bs that surrounds us. and that which is good lasts forever. that is the true faith not the false faith of the corrupt warden who in this case is not only the proverbial devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a man of god only because of his fanatical devotion to the bible. the irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. the ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated greek tragedy as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans in this case between two very different kind of humans both by background as well as race but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them to get busy living rather than to get busy dying. finally what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. for the serious it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes _ã_ a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.the greatest movie of all time everything was great. if you are a true batman fan you must watch. the whole trilogy are wonder full just wish christian bale would come out in the man of steel sequel.people had doubts about heath ledger but i believe he nailed it. i always recommend this movie too people who havent seen it.i think chris nolan and zack snyder make a great team and should diffidently keep going for more hits. possibly make a justice league in the future great storyline .... just sad to hear about heath ledger his performance we be remembered.if you like this film i also recommend the dark knight rises tom hardy also does a great performance. great job to allthe greatest movie ever made.. period. pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve. the film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.it will bring tears to your eyes. it will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. it will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. and it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. the performances are simply mind boggling be it tim robbins or morgan freeman or countless others. and it is difficult to believe this was the debut of frank darabont as a director.if you havent already seen it... please do otherwise you are missing something.the first time i saw this movie was at a friends house i was only 11 at the time and i never really understood the real content of the movie but as i grew older and matured i watched it over and over again and now that i know what it is all about i can appreciate it a little more the movie became my life i would watch it almost everyday and never get sick of it i would show it to my friends and anyone else who was interested in watching it i dont know why it took me like it did but there was just something about it a film filled with great one liners and sayings that would make you look at the world of crime a lot more differently very offensive in more ways than one but if you can manage to look past the endless use of four letter words than you will probably like it if you havent seen pulp fiction than see it because you will miss the number one movie of all timethe first time i saw this film i said those three words a lot to my friends and family. shawshank redemption is the best film i have ever seen in my lifetime. i have seen tons of films. morgan freeman gave a performance that will touch anyones heart. from beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.the first thing that came to my mind when i left the theater was oh man that movie was f#$@ awesome this movie is unbelievable. it is different from other superhero movies mostly because of its plot and the great dialogs but also the way the action scenes are presented. nolan has done a very good job and there is no way you will get bored or tired of the endless action. however the one and only feature that makes this film special is the enemy. the joker has become even more popular after the dark knight and became maybe the most likable villain. his goal isnt money or power he wants to see the gotham destroyed and corrupt its people as more as he can. but what makes him unique is that instead of killing batman which would make him reach his goal much easier he enjoys playing with him and torture him not physically but mentally. the awesomeness of this character completes with heath ledgers epic performance delivering the role of his lifetime. in my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie but also one of the best movies ive ever seen. if you like superhero movies you will love it if you are not a big fun of this kind but you enjoy a good action movie_ã_ you will love itthe first reason for see this movie is angelina jolie but all in this movie is incredible dressing images music story visual effects a different story in this movie you found why maleficient go to the castle also you understand the roles of other characters the voice of angelina jolie is attractive but at the same time you feel fear about her most of us knew about this story when we were children but is fantastic watch this movie now in real action we could talk about this movie like feminist i watch this movie twice and i suggest all my family go to watch it sincerely i hope disney did this with all their classic moviethe first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie brilliant and engaging endlessly quotable and visually alluring pf made all the top lists regenerated john travolta solidified bruce willis centered samuel l washington as a leading man and cemented christopher walken among creepiest of cameos ever the side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest they discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner and we actually see very little violence play out tarantinos use of the chopped up time line only added to the pulp mystique as well as its charm imbecile gangsters charming regressive american social interaction cinema worthy when combined  it remains a perfect storm for quintin & companythe final chapter of this great trilogy will just rip your heart out of your ribs i dont know how peter jackson did itand perhaps sucha masterpiece such as this has the right not to be questioned. i loved the first movie its steady pace of adventure is non-stop the characters are loveable the costume is nice the settings are stupendous and the visual effects is jaw-dropping. and i loved the second even better with the battle of helms deep finally winning over my breaking heart with the two lotr movies already gnawing at the bottom i had to say a final farewell to star wars 4 & 5 and welcome the llord of the rings. and with this my heart is fainally complete. the marmaluks are unstoppable and visually great no words could describe the intensity of their presence alone. and the battle of pelanor fields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself and not as an orc though trolls are cool though pales in comparisson with the mass of undead and of course the oliphaunts. gollum is once again as great as ever and the rest of the cast are comendable with great praises going to be due to gandalf and most especially sam the emotional intensity of the film is a full ten and after you cry from the movies story youll cry about why oh why wasnt it any longer and indeed we must now bid a final farewell to our dearest the lord of the rings trilogy the only trilogy to have a complete set of movies with no equals but each other. good bye........ sorry i just dont wanna leave it alone....the film is very well directed and scripted yet the film also shows that quentin tarantino is far better a director than an actor definitely an 10 out of 10 film but quentin tarantino should stick to the superb directing instead of the dreadful actingthe film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions men overexploited land resources which is why the only goal they have left is to survive this life is not enough for cooper brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body and soul to this character but all of this wouldnt hold without the total control of christopher nolan based on the languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer the luminous and impenetrable photography of hoyte van hoytema and the sincerity of nolans directing he manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time always in harmony with hans zimmers soundtrack to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years thus we are transported into the same cockpit that cooper we feel the same remorse that he can already feel we feel the same gravity and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will all of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film to directly jump from when cooper leaves in his truck leaving his family behind him to endurance taking off this simple editing decision allows nolan to give an original movement to his film and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film you dont necessarily have to understand it immediately  the film will raise questions in you such as  what is it to be a human being is there some physical limitations to our humanity how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge is there other dimensions that we can not access to and above all what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? is this bond only intelligible or is it also tangible ? all these questions resonate in harmony in nolans interstellar interstellar is itself a crescendo increasing sensitivity and creativity i use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by hans zimmer which is one of the most beautiful music ever d for a scifi movie we are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement a total symbiosis a bit like the music of gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality zimmers crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations and manages to extend them sometimes almost to choking before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spellbounded i have seen all the talent of the director that i knew he was outside the norm but whom i did not know his capacity to reinvent itself because this is it interstellar is not an action movie not really a blockbuster and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people its much more than that this is much more than just a scifi movie it is unlike any of his previous films some hoped to see interstellar as christopher nolans best film and they were disappointed that this was not the case and indeed this is not the best film of christopher nolan because in a way it is his first film im not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films it goes beyond all of them but to me interstellar is the first film of a new stage in nolans filmography  it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead interstellar is the proof that nolan has finally managed despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of the dark knight to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work original humble sincere and deeply meticulously measured now in this third act of the film it all comes to life with unparalleled strength nolan poses and answers questions that raise others but he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them but nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy from my point of view only solaris by steven soderbergh 2002 unfortunately neglected by the audience was able to accomplish that interstellar is based on a premise which is the following  from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species as we always leave a part of ourselves behind us in other words i could say that this is a human story and even if we go as far as we want to if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of we will only get closer to them because the separation and thus the distance and time can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other because it is going to the end of the world when we reach the end of ourselves that we reach the singularity of the black hole beyond the horizon *  it is our humanity no i

fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. the story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. the movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. peter jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. the return of the king culminates its three story lines unimaginably. as the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why peter jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. i enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. the action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. but even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. as frodo and sam make their way to mount doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. we see the real power of friendship as gollum continues to try to break it. when aragorn and gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at helms deep. i become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. the feelings of community within us. this is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10the fact that i can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. there are some movies that i cringe my way through or am so bored that i check the time and cant wait for it to be over but not the lotr. this movie perfectly captures the world that tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. the acting cast cgi wardrobe and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. from the mountain of books in the background of bilbos study to the rust and grime on the armor of the orc berserkers its the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable and timelessly beautiful.the epic conclusion to this outstanding story. i have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of peter jacksons work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy. the combined flawlessness of the the acting the script the filming the special effects and most importantly for me the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films. an outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. a 10/10 for this film along with the previous two.  violent but in a cool way. shocking but in a cool way. i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more. its a rich intertextual film going experience. its a gangstar movie. for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy. its a renegade boxer story. its easy rider deliverance and shaft. its a film noir its a melodrama. its romance and action. its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious. if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one. the entire lord of the rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. this whole trilogy was the reason why i became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. i remember seeing the two towers and the return of the king when they were respectively being released in theaters. both of the movies blew me away. they were unlike anything i had ever seen in my life. this was a driving force to me because now i wanted to read not only the lord of the rings and other tolkien books but also the r. a. salvatore and dark sun world books. this was such an influential movie to me and i hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. good acting epic battle scenes convincing dialogue well-done settings and an awesome story all comprise the entire lotr trilogy. i say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre first baptized by lord of the ringsthe ending to lord of the rings is not only great and powerful but it will become a movie that is remembered for ages. the actors portrayed the characters perfectlytheir performances are memorable and the story is unforgetable. this movie and its actors deserve a nods at the oscars this year.the dark night is amazing. i have seen it three times already and i am going to see it again. i didnt like batman begins. i thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. this film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on. the acting is great. christian bale is the best batman yet.every time i think of alfred i now see micheal caine. the real star of the show is heath ledger as the joker. he is creepy psychotic and funny in a very twisted way. 2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. this is the best film i have seen so far this year.the dark knight was the best of the christopher nolan trilogy heath ledgers joker is the best his raw talent and natural feel for the character will never be repeated the talent over all in the series was out of this world..michael cainmorgan freeman christian bale & gary oldman to name a few the passion of this trilogy really comes out in the dark knight why so serious & do you want to know how i got these scars have become house hold quotes my love for batman became stronger cause of these 3 movies everyone should see them rent them buy them but watch them they are that great i recommend a marathon of all the moviesthe dark knight was probably the best action film ive ever seen. not only is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excellentthe dark knight was and still is nothing short of a masterpiece and a mind bending acting demonstration. the plot special effects acting choreography and the ability to entice a viewer into the movie itself puts it in its own category of genius. heath ledger is the movie. a perfect example of an actor who put on his best final performance never coming out of character and before you know itthe dark knight was a marvelous film. it shows us what a city might be like with potentially unstoppable criminals and corrupt police officers. my favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. corruption has taken over gpd and gothem is becoming a horrible city. some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. a world where the police have no power can scare the bejeezus out of anyone. the cast and soundtrack were also excellent. my favorites were morgan freemanlucky # slevin and aaron eckhartthe black dahlia. christain bale was also excellent in the film. the soundtracks were terrific. hans zimmerpearl harbor soundtrack made the movie come to life. everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack and the dark knight truly proves that point. imagine the movie titanic without the music. it would not be as good. same thing applies for any movie. the movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enoughthe dark knight trilogy consists of three of my many all time favourite movies. each movie is as good as each other. however when christopher nolan dropped the sequel surrounded with buzz and anticipationthe dark knight tops batman begins enormously. the line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. if you thought the first was good then this is the ultimate superhero film. the fact is it doesnt even have the feel of a superhero flick. yes you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and yes you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer youll see the hero is a vigilante and youll see that his suit is very lethal and isnt a red and blue spandex outfit. and look closer at the villain and youll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very very clever. the star of the film however isnt bats. its heath ledger as the joker. his death a few months after the release of the film was tragic so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. he is the glue of the film. the storyline is very good without being too serious. a bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. see this film and you will be amazed.the dark knight that came out in 2008 starring christian bale heath ledger aaron eckhart michael caine gary oldman morgan freeman and maggie gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of batman. when batman gordon and harvey dent tries bring down the mob they face a new threat the joker who raises hell in gotham. what unfolds is a 150 min of high pace crime thriller. the story is quite dark complex and engaging. the cast is just amazing. heath ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his last role. his each dialogue is just amazing. i kinda love every sec he is in on the screen. the joker can be considered one of the best villains of all time. christian bale is amazing in his best role of batman. though not as screen time as he had in the last movie batman begins but still he gave an amazing performance. aaron eckhart as harvey dent was quite good. after joker harvey had 2nd best dialogues of the movie. pacing of the movie is awesome too. there wont be any part of the movie which feels slow or boring mainly because every conversation is important. action is kinda different and unique making it amazing . overall the dark knight is an outstanding movie. plot:10/10 dialogue:10/10 acting:10/10 action:10/10 pace:10/10 overall:10/10the dark knight surpassed all my expectations. visually the film is rich. it has that expensive big-budget look about it without it being too overwhelming. the action has been directed stylishly by nolan again it looks astounding whilst at the same time being easy on the eye you wont find michael bays trademark shakey-cam in this film. the action is great yes but the smaller dramatic sequences are where this film raises the bar of the superhero genre a bar previously set by its predecessor batman begins. the entire cast suit their roles and play them with conviction. as expected the standout performance comes from heath ledger as the joker - its an oscar-worthy performance in my view - but the entire main castthe dark knight rises is a masterpiece. its a movie i can watch over and over. it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. he played the joker perfectly. the movie ends very well. its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested. i believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. at least number 2. this movie doesnt overload you on any one element. theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too. nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. this isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker. the joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it. there is so many plot twists. all in all. watch this movie if you havent already. its awesomethe dark knight not only pushes the boundaries to be a better super hero film it not only pushes the boundaries to be a better drama- it pushes the boundaries of masterpiece. it is a near-perfect depiction of how one man can really make a difference good or bad. this makes the film more compelling than the average action film. i will not go into detail about heath ledgers performance but in short it changed the industry. if you havent seen this film yet exit this page dont rent the movie buy it and just watch it until you realize that you are seeing a film of class and quality and know that every second that goes by is worth it.  not a single minute could be considered a bad acting well at least i think so. entertaining for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. i am not a huge fan of tim robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. mr. freeman stays solid as usual in his act. the dark knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this batman apart. the film takes us to a gotham city that has grown accustomed to the big bats crime-fighting crusades and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. they form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney harvey dent. recognizing the crime groups looming extinction a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill batman. the bad guys dont know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman and they later learn the hard way that they dont really have a choice for the most disturbing part of the jokers personality is his motive. he doesnt care about money or power. he just enjoys causing trouble and watching with pleasure from the sidelines as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film heath ledger. ledgers performance as the joker is astounding and consuming. we come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. he develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. yet he has no problem building an army of followers and the viewers easily find that believable. as insane as he is hes focused and quite determined. ledger also brings the jokers humor to the role but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. the very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. the evil is incredibly convincing. although batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. in addition to the dark images the violence both seen and implied is sometimes unsettling and ledgers joker is chilling even for adult viewers. having said that this is by far one of the best films ive ever seen and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. i am only disappointed that this joker the best villain in a film since hannibal lecter will never be revealed to us again.  along the way we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside shawshank. the movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next never feeling forced or losing your interest. the movie is mostly dialogue driven but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life. finally the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. i do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it but suffice to say the final act of the movie leaves you floored. both times that i saw it i was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. forrest gump and pulp fiction are both great movies highly entertaining. i particularly love pulp fiction  however it is a travesty that the shawshank redemption did not win best picture. it was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion arguably the best film of the decade and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. the even bigger tragedy though is that while morgan freeman earned an oscar nomination for his great performance tim robbins turn as andy dufresne went without a nomination. robbins carries the film and his performance is truly one of the greatest i have ever seen. the bottom line is that the shawshank redmption is a perfect movie. it takes you in from the opening scene and doesnt let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. along the way it will make you think fear wonder and feel a number of other emotions. if you have not seen this movie waste no time  go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on imdb.  the dark knight is the second part of batman franchise with christian bale the movie is great with solid acting performing action directing. everything is perfect the ensemble of the cast is great. watched dark knight rises as well. the batman franchise with christian bale is the best. dark knight is one of my favourite movies of all times because of the action and of course i love christian bales acting. i sure do hope that there is another batman movie after dark knight rises because i can see this from every fan that its gonna break all the records. just like dark knight rises topped all the charts. i loved heath ledgers acting as well nice to see some aussies doing great in hollywood loved the part where he blows up the hospital and the way he walks i even met christian bale in person he is a great guy doesnt disappoint his fans. i really really hope that they make another batman movie with christian bale in it and anne hathaway they look cute together or they could make batman and robin hood.the dark knight is the quintessential comic book meets realism film. heath ledger and aaron eckhart knock it completely out of the park. every single character shows the most growth/development having to compromise their own personal opinion. it is a non-stop start to finish thrill ride with a detective story woven in. some men just want to see the world burn i just want to watch this movie again and again. gary oldman and maggie gyllenhall really shine in their roles. you wont even notice katie holmes departure. christian bale is still a fairly terrible batman but he makes for a damn good bruce wayne. the final minutes of this film were so powerful that they are still debated despite being put to rest with the opening of the third movie.the dark knight is the long awaited sequel to 2005s critically acclaimed batman begins and the second part of christopher nolans batman trilogy. it stars christian bale michael caine gary oldman and morgan freeman who reprise their role from batman begins. new to the cast are maggie gyllenhaal replacing katie holmes as rachel dawes aaron eckhart as gothams ambitious new da harvey dent and heath ledger as infamous batman villain the joker. the premise of this movie is that batman and lieutenant jim gordon one of the citys few in-corrupt cops are trying to take down the mob with the help of harvey dent gothams white knight. however while focusing on bringing the mob down a new threat emerges  hes under a life sentence for murder. tim robbins is andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover which he--like most other inmates say theyre not guilty of. and bob gunton is warden norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of bible reading and strict discipline. while fortunately ive had no first hand experience shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society. a long movie most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments. as the story unfolds increasingly we come to see andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. and in andys work for warden norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity substance. in roger eberts first review of his two of this movie he said: ....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason.... most viewers will agree. the dark knight is the best super hero movie till done and one of the best movies ever created in hollywood.. christopher nolan created a masterpiece he is known to create some original screenplays in hollywood.. and he has done that in this batman movie too.. this movie is unforgettable by nolans treatment to a superhero movie and the brilliant performance by heath ledger... a charismatic performance that earned him an postmoustly oscar.. we will miss him and he will be always remembered as the joker.. a new way of approach than jack nicholsons joker and he nailed it.. christian bale and aron eckheart are also doing an amazing work but its all overshadowed by heath ledgers performance... instead of a usual fantasy film this batman movie goes to the dark side and took it seriously.. while watching this movie we could say that this super hero is truly a human.. a must watch movie for every batman fan and every good movie fanthe dark knight is second movie of christopher nolans batman trilogy and released in 2008 after three years from first movie batman begins. normally sequence movies cannot catch the same success with first one but the dark knight surpassed it and gone way beyond expectations. its first movie has 8.3 point on imdb and dark knight got 9.0 point and became 6th of top 250 imdb. all three movies are inspired by batman comics but it has some changes. in this version nolan had chosen to use the joker as an antagonist to batman. in whole movie we saw a sort of competition between batman and joker. joker tries to prove that everybody has a dark side even the nice ones and how insanity is close to people he says madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push. when everything is getting worse joker manages to turn movies nicest and heroic man harvey dent into two-face which is also a fictional character in batman comics. addition to its well developed story its visual effects are amazing. although it lasts two and a half hours i did not want it to end even a second. actually the biggest reason i love this movie that i think it is a joker movie instead of batman. the first scene of the movie starts with the joker theme which is one of the soundtracks of the movie. i think it is a really good choice to makes audience tense and get ready to watch an action movie. then while jokers crew rob bank we get some information about joker. after the robbery he kills all of his men i believe that is a good way to introduce audience with his carelessness and mercilessness. he manages to escape from the bank by enter a school buses traffic and we meet his intelligence right there. after a few scenes later joker entered gangsters of gotham citys special meeting and when they about to kill him he puts a pencil on a table and says  i am going to make this pencil disappear when one of the body guard comes near to him he grab his head push to pencil then pencil disappears. i know loving this scene makes me a sort of masochist but if i had watched it in a horror movie i would not like it i like the way nolan build the conversation and the scene. later on at that scene joker offers to kill batman and if he kills they will give him their half of money. they say you are crazy and do not agree with him he leaves to them his card. i like this symbol very much because the card is the joker card of playing cards which we use in our daily life to play card game. on the other side batman just develops his equipments i think nolan make our expectations higher in this progress. i was really curious about what will happen when the two enemies meets. joker kills the people who inspired by batman and wears like him acts like him. joker hangs one of them and put a note on his fake batman costume  will the real batman please stand up . i really like the little tease in there there is a song by eminem the real slim shady he says the real slim shady please stand up and he is the real slim shady he calls for himself because there is a lot of people who tries to imitate him. joker does the same thing in movie he want real batman to take off his mask and show himself otherwise gotham will not be a peaceful city. i really like the way he treats him. he does not have a real purpose to do all his action or terror he just does these because he is insane. in other movies they generally give us a background about antagonist their life or why they are bad we know all things but in this movie joker does not have even a finger print history on governments database. we do not know even why he has scars on his face but in the movie he tells two different stories about it. the famous catch phrase why so serious comes in here. these stories have one thing in common actually it is about smiling. he leads chaos and he has always a smile on his face this is a good symbol to show his satisfaction from the situation he made. though he wears no heavy costume like batman wears he can handle with batman how does it possible he always uses batmans weakness. batman has ethics joker does not. in this movie batman obsesses with rachel and joker use this very intelligently and mercilessly. besides joker leaves clues about who is he going to kill next of course these are not ordinary citizens. he chooses a judge a commissioner and harvey dent. he sends even a message to the judge. when we see his message which is his card we understand that joker is going to do something. but the judge does not realize it. i like the irony in there. even police officers tell her to be careful and give her a letter which writes that where should she goes to be safe. as an answer to them the judge says that i am get used to these people and then she gets on her car. then she opens letter and it writes  up . the car explores and it scatters the joker card. this is one of my favorite scenes. he knows how he can leave his signature after accident happens. he also chooses people like him to make part of his crew. one of them is a schizoid and when harvey dent gets him he cannot tell anything logically about joker. they cannot reach joker due to the way he works.the dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all-time. i really didnt expect much before i saw the film but when i did i was complete blown away. this is the way superhero movies should be made instead of making forgettable popcorn flicks. all actors that includes christian bale heath ledger aaron eckhart michael cain gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman brought there a game in the superhero drama. this movie isnt overrated because it deserves all the credit its been getting including heath ledgers performance as the joker. the movie had a great script thanks to christopher nolan and his brother jonathan. the acting cinematography action and editing is outstanding and all the film crews did a phenomenal job. id like to thank the director christopher nolan for influencing me as an aspiring filmmaker and putting a lot of heart into the dark knight. 10 out of 10the dark knight is my favorite movie ever made partly because im a huge batman fan but also just because its simply put one of the best movies ever made. this is the sequel to the reasonably successful and marginally critically acclaimed batman begins which was a good start but hardly fantastic due to its at times slow pace and lack of all-star villains. the sequel on the other hand makes up for that tenfold with its masterful storytelling and amazing villains. in this story gotham is a better place than before batman with less mobsters and criminals on the streets but when a crazed criminal calling himself the joker heath ledger begins subjecting the citizens of gotham to his chaos and anarchy batman christian bale must step in. possibly the only way batman can stop this evil lunatic is with the help of lt james gordon gary oldman and gothams white knight district attorney harvey-dent aaron eckhart. the scene is complicated when the joker moves to corrupt the entire city including harvey dent and all hope could be lost. the movie is filled with classic catchphrases and scenes mainly thanks to the joker such as why so serious and lets put a smile on that face. the character the joker is one of if not the greatest villains in cinematic history because of his immense presence classic and thought provoking dialog and of course the oscar winning posthumous performance of the late great heath ledger. the character is the exact ying to batmans yang in every way and if there was ever going to be a villain to beat batman and go against his moral code it would the dark knights joker. speaking of heath ledger his acting is absolutely first class in this movie. ledger locked himself in hotel room for a month prior to shooting the dark knight so he could get the character right and boy did it work. he also designed the jokers creepy and menacing make- up and co-directed and directed a couple of scenes featuring the joker. this performance is one of the greatest by an actor for quite some time and will never be forgotten. other than heath ledger the acting in the movie is still really great with christian bale reprising his role as batman while still doing his gravely batman voice which i actually quite like. aaron eckhart plays a fantastic harvey dent and has good chemistry with maggie gyllenhaal who plays his love interest rachel. the directing by christopher nolan is magnificent giving the film a gritty and realistic feel while also keeping the audience caring about the characters. the way he used mostly practical effects for the movie also helped the movie along by making it stand out a bit from other blockbuster movies like the transformers movies which are just an orgy of cgi and loud noises. this movie on the other hand is subtle while also being a very strong and forceful movie by having strong themes and ways of conveying them. the story and the overall tone of the film is much more than just a comic movie its a dark and serious action/drama film. this is technically a comic book movie although it really doesnt have any supernatural themes or anything that really makes a movie a comic book movie like the avengers or spider-man. this movie could easily have happened in our world thats how believable the movie really is. to compare this movie to other comic book movies is unfair to comic book movie because this is no ordinary movie this is a fantastic masterpiece of film. although the highlight of the movie is the joker this is first and foremost a batman story and a damn good one. this film delves like no other into the mindset and psyche of batman and his moral code. batman will never kill anyone even his greatest enemy which can be a big advantage to his opponent but it gives him a mantra and code to live by. the joker pushes batman to the absolute limits like no other villain has before which is just another reason why its the greatest batman story of all time. the only problems with the movie are more nit-picking mistakes rather than actual problems with the movie. the mistakes are continuity errors with the color of the joker hair changing in the opening scene and his arm moving back and before around batmans arm between cuts in one scene. every movie makes mistakes and these are just two little annoying errors most people wont notice unless they see the movie as many times as i have. dark knight is a wonderfully awesome film with fantastic acting directing writing and is just about an all-round perfect in every way film. i do not say this about many films because most films have gaping plot holes or stupid characters but this film doesnt. i would recommend this movie to just about anyone except if youre a grandma maybe you wont like it so much. its the closest a movie has ever come to being perfect. i rate this movie a 10/10.  the most prominent one being gil bellows late as billy of ally mcbeal as tommy a fellow inmate of andys who suffers under the iron will of norton. if you havent seen this movie go and rent it now. you will not be disappointed. it is positively the best movie of the 90s and one of my top 3 of all time. this movie is a spectacle to move the mind soul and heart. 10/10 the dark knight is everything i wanted a batman film to be and it has that level of darkness that a lot of superhero films just dont have. the story has a lot of depth. the cast is great. the way nolan used chicago as his gotham made the film look larger than life. there is a sense of realism compared to pre-nolan batman films. i could go on and on especially since batman is my favorite superhero and that character played a huge role in my childhood whether it was the cartoons or the burton/schumacher films. people say that they had a problem with christian bales batman voice but to me personally it doesnt take away from the film because the essence of the character is still there. heath ledgers joker in my opinion has a become an iconic villain of cinema. unlike jack nicholsons portrayal of the joker heath ledgers joker will actually disturb you more than make you laugh. i always identified the joker with the animated series version voiced by mark hamill. that was the iconic joker but to have an actor being able to rise to that standard and reinvent a super villain was something i really did not expect before i even saw the dark knight. and that is really evident especially when batman and joker are both on screen. every interaction between them somehow brings back my memories of watching the animated series only this time its live action and its more mature and darker than i ever imagined my favorite superhero and supervillain to be. i could go on about the rest of the cast such as michael cane gary oldman and aaron eckhart for their fantastic portrayal of the characters. not only is this a fantastic superhero film but this is also a fantastic piece of cinema. if i could ever go back in time to witness this film for the first time over and over again i would just to feel the aura of excitement coming from me and everyone in the theater. i didnt know what to expect with the dark knight just as much as i did not know what to expect with batman begins. i was expecting a good ol superhero story but instead i was watching a reinvented batman and a re-imagining of the story i always knew of the character. the old batman films were fun for me as a child but the rebooted franchise definitely inspired me to read the graphic novels that played a part in influencing nolans vision. every scene is shockingly dark captivating but most importantly iconic and memorable and i sure hope that this film has a far reaching influence on other superhero films because the film really set the bar for the genre. every other superhero i will watch unfortunately will be compared to the dark knight and it will be judged based on that film. these are the only superhero films of its kind and the fact that it stands out from the rest shows how much quality the film has and how much it gets right. the dark knight is a classic in every sense of the word not just as a superhero film but as a work of storytelling in general.the dark knight is based upon the batman characters created by bob kane and is a follow up to 2005s batman begins. i remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that i stated that i didnt even know if i would end up going to see the dark knight. after giving batman begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why i wouldnt want to see a sequel to a film i enjoyed so much. well when i saw batman begins in the theatres i thought it had a lot of style action and kept me compelled and entertained and i found it a really good time at the movies. hence the perfect review i gave it three years ago. then i saw it again on dvd and i did not like it at all. the thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things i enjoyed about it on my first viewing instead on my second viewing i found parts of it boring and i started to have a few problems with the acting performances. i still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year i really couldnt have cared less if i saw the dark knight at all. then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and i kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and i even heard of one critic who couldnt recommend the film because of how dark it was. this intrigued me because i have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that i would really like it ended up in me seeing it. and to my surprise i thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and i would most certainly call it a masterpiece. the acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late heath ledger who played the role of the joker. i have seen heath ledger in other films such as brokeback mountain or im not there and to play this role he isnt more or less playing himself but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the joker says does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. all of this is perfected by heath ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and i would compare his performance as the joker to last years best performance of daniel day lewis as daniel plainview in there will be blood. day lewis won an oscar this year so i see no reason why heath ledger couldnt get nominated or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. his performance was one of the best parts of the film. what was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting direction and cinematography was its story. instead of being filled by non stop explosions high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including batman himself. the character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldnt help but be interested. the story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and i liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which i found all the more interesting and i liked how this film did not use formulas or clichê©s and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. the dark knight really hit me and made an impression on me. even days after leaving the theatre i am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. this is what i call a powerful thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. the dark knight is a brilliant achievement and i will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film i have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and i hope it is not shunned come oscar time.the dark knight is arguably the best movie ive ever seen on the big screen. it has everything that a viewer would want in a good film. the director has done a fantastic job. christian bale is the best batman/bruce wayne..i cant imagine anyone else filling for him. even the bad guys in this movie are awesome. the point that you dont know anything about the joker makes him a questionable character  get it . the joker cant kill batman because hes just too fun and batman has his own rules that he cant break  such as killing a man . the transformation of harvey dent was scary and the 50/50 chance of him murdering someone is even scarier because nobody knows who will survive. chance is unbiased said harvey. the ending is also quite atrocious for bales character. he has to disappear or else hell be hunted. why is he running dad - j.g juniorthe dark knight is an perfect attempt from nolan to show actual dark side of society. where hero must pay penalty for chaos created by villain. this is an critic and perfectly meant to disclose acting skills of each comic characters of batman franchise. all credits has been given to ledger who drove this movie from an ordinary comic movie to epic one. interviews of heath was perfectly showing how much heath was involved in character the joker observed lip sucking gestures in interviews. any where we never saw heath in movie instead it was an agent of chaos. this movie is never overrated. this movie is over qualified for ratingthe dark knight is an amazing movie the script is very well written the acting the visual effects its really hits you on an emotional level which is something most films dont do nowadays. i recommend it to everyone who loves batman even if you dont like batman youll still love this movie. it is probably christopher nolans most successful films next to inception. if you want to be emerged in a real life gotham then this is the movie to see though the old batman films portray a very comic book-like gotham this one shows that anything including the villains even batman is very possible to happen. if you enjoyed the origin youll most definitely like this one. it has your action adventure comedy thrown in and out throughout the movie and even your romance.you cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet people gave it 10 it is unwatchable i dont worry about foul language for the most part but a lot of effwords in a movie clearly targeted at 1012 yearold boys is a bit much it was just plain retarded from the getgo and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff and i love michael caine mark strong and colin firth  i figured how can you go wrong? i truly cant figure out who the audience is for this garbage total waste of $11 bucks wouldnt have even watched it free on the internetyes you read that header right thats how revolting i found this movie is this how women think nowadays? huh??? seriously??? is this how were going to start teaching women how to behave?? and what kind of a dumbass is neil patrick harris character for taking her back in?? gillian flynn clearly has fantasies about men being that stupid i mean really? what man would be stupid enough to take in a woman who fakes her own death? the phrase from the movie natural born killers comes to mind look bitch you knew i was a snake gillian flynn needs therapy because i can tell you all that this is not how marriage is supposed to be my mom and dad were married 21 years til death did they part and they yelled at each other twice and were rarely apart and loved each other dearly that is how a marriage is supposed to be dont believe this devil bitchs lies people if this is how women are going to start behaving i am never dating ever again as long as i live this movie and this nutjob who wrote this are proof positive its time for another flood gentlemen what we have here is a crazy bitchcedric the entertainerwow talk about the most misrepresented show on television arrow purports to be an actionadventure show about a superhero in reality it is as far from that as possible the movie annie has more action and adventure than arrow if this show has been recommended to you then i hope you are a fan of melodrama i call this show arrow 90210 taking out the commercials you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of arrow and about 5 mins of action i was really excited to watch this show i am a fan of the comic book and i liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern when i saw the pilot i thought it was interesting the whole subplot no spoilers in this review was intriguing and the show overall was interesting i did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department is that guy a robot? have they updated his emotional responses yet? and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome i still thought it had potential much to my chagrin the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly by the fourth episode i was bored i turned it off i absolutely could not watch any further i found that i didnt care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters and if the villain ever showed up dont blink or youll miss him i was rooting for him to winworst movie i have seen in ever and it goes one for over 2 and a half hours? it was awful there were many collective audience groans when i viewed this film and the endinghorrible i could have written a better piece of garbage i was unimpressed with ben afflecks plight but then i was amazed that i was even less interested in the flight of the gone girl and then to my horror i realized we had to suffer thru the whole part at the lake houseugh and then the stupid ending i seriously do not know how this was released in good faith i guess they just needed to try to get some money back for their effortsworst hero movie ever seen bad screenplay bad director worst director and actors  what can they do with such a director they suck james gunn play tetris for a 2014 move in my opinion its like a 1910 sf movie this movie want to be a parody $hit whatever but they hit a wall biiig time superhero never this movie sukcs biig time imdb should allow 0 for a score this is my score 0 from what i can see 20132014 in my opinion was the worst years for hollywood crappy scripts and crappier moviesworst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and i was still waiting for something to happen i would of had a more productive time watching grass grow dont waste your time watching this film i dont see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve it went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it the most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15 it was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody he was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didnt go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didnt achieve much it was a pointless film it was like the film was made to actually be as bad boring and ordinary as possible not one part of the film was embellished or interesting to sum it up an awful filmwith what seems like a million different versions of this classic fairytale you would think disney would go all out and make this one new and exciting but still keep the core parts the same however what you get is a very outdated movie with acting that is mediocre at best the only part i found interesting and enjoyable on film is when the fairy godmother played by helena carter shows up and does her thing turning the pumpkin into a carriage etc the animated version will always be the best but i dont think even young girls will be able to enjoy this just way too dull and it felt like an eternitywhy do we watch movies instead of living our dull boring lives? it is to give us momentary entertainment and allow us to dream of what we could accomplish if we are in the right circumstances and try hard enough boyhood is the gateway into the life of an average american boy showing us absolutely nothing basically the only good comment this movie receives is that it is similar to real life and gives you the chance to watch the actors grow throughout the movie that is it this movie attempts to do something risky that does not guarantee success but after all you cannot have a movie simply based on you know how everyones always saying seize the moment? i dont know im kind of thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us for a movie to be successful you need a plot which the movie does not have good acting which only the father provides and originality not the portrayal of an average kid with a shitty life and no skills at all the only good thing you can see from this movie is the actors growing up and for that you might as well see harry potter and so it is with the utmost sincerity that i recommend you watch all 8 harry potter films and receive the entertainment you deservewhere to start? this movie is so flawed it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame first the music is actually very annoying repetitive and grandiloquent it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours second the characters are completely flat and uninteresting their emotions feel mechanical and the bad characters simply act erratically as a function of the need of the story third the dialogs are full of platitudes love cannot be measured says the astrophysicist or outright absurdity gravity can travel through time and become laughable at times the worst is clearly the scenario in addition to marx brothers physics relativistic effects without relativistic velocity 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water goofy space exploration you land first and then you start thinking about what kind of planet it is the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted apparently a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole it would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a storywhere to start this isnt anything to do with sleeping beauty apart from the names even then the three good fairies names change who are knotgrass thistlewit and flittle? shouldnt it be flora fauna and merryweather whats the point in changing the names it adds to the complete difference between sleeping beauty and maleficent since when did maleficent see aurora everyday in sleeping beauty she sends her warthog things to find aurora but they have been looking in cradles for 16 years so she sends her ravencrow to find aurora however in maleficent they become really good friends and maleficent wants aurora to stay with her what?? some if this is from the book i read so im blaming the book as well here since when did the queen die? at the end of sleeping beauty it pictures her with stefan while phillip and aurora dance happy ending in maleficent auroras parents both die wow and its not like disney to suffocate someone as in stefan and king henry and making the ravencrow be the dragon totally takes it away from maleficent that was a main part in the story in sleeping beauty but now its a meh moment seriously quit while your ahead frozen was amazing so disney should have waited a but to find new ideas not just launch into another movie which a lot of people seem to dislike for the same reasons thus film takes it away from frozen i could honestly go on but it would take all day to point out the flaws in the book and the film the storyline is what makes a storyfilm yeah characters are important but if the story is untrue and totally contradicts itself how can the actors look good films have to make actors look good maleficent doesnt im usually a massive fan of disney but whoever wrote this needs to watch sleeping beauty againwhen i want to watch a movie i want to watch something exciting something attracting and at least not a waste of time this movie was obviously way too boring firstly it was way ahead then its times even ahead then star trek and its voyages coming to reality jhonny d is one brilliant actor when ever his movies are out he character and role is not only challenging but different this time it was ridiculous i dont know but i believe he would worked only for a matter a few minutes while working for the entire movie rest of the cast is brilliant but perhaps they are also deceive by the script i agree script is new completely futuristic and fascinating but the way they are adapted it and put it up on the screen was too boring there are scenes of action some really freaky stuff too but its not exciting its not attracting you to watch it again and again its too predictable you can not only guess the next scene but even the dialogues in short its a horrible movie to watch i was 110% bored while watching it but then again if you are a johnny d fan and nothing else to do in life then watch itwhen i started to watch the show i really didnt like the regular story from the past insertions but sadly after more and more episodes those became actually far more interesting that the main story then i stopped watching it really felt that i can just watch any episode in any order and i wouldnt even know if i had seen it or not it was all so cookie cutter the main character is not bad but then it goes pretty down from there now i realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break there can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane plot that tries to carry this series through pap is too good a word for this garbage when i saw this was directed by chris nolan i said theres no way i can miss this movie then i checked out the ratings on imdb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep this movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future however when cooper goes to his daughters school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube tv in the classroom huh? tube tvs cant be found anywhere in 2014 yet were expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? they made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and thats it ok so whats the point going through the worm hole was ok but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical like out of a disney fairytale this film was filled with a listers but fell flat matt damons character was totally predictable and so was the ending i really dont understand the appeal and high ratingswhen i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first told me it was awesome after watching it since then i held my expectations high but i was greatly disappointed to be honest i dont even know where to start the film is a huge clich overall and a ridiculous mess starting with the characters and the actors that give them life we have great names in the industry which of course grants the film some status still my only thought about this was what the hell are you guys doing in this film? seriously? renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudofunny acting which doesnt turn out to be funny isnt exactly the perfect recipe i dont dislike zoe saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesnt even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance to provide her character some individuality most of the plot holes if not all of them are found in the main characters whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense one minute gamora was trying to kill peter quill and five minutes later quill was saving her because hes that good just like they are best friends forever after that the love interest feels so so forced becauseã plot thankfully we dont get to see them kissing or whatever otherwise that would be a bigger face palm the background stories are boring with no consistence and so clich theres nothing new about them in gamoras case we step onto mary sues grounds the usual wannabe badass whos actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldnt even see in filmsã oh and of course talking about footloose and a lizard fight to extend the length of the film i couldnt feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters so that means they are doing it wrongã the sentimental scenes meant nothing and i couldnt care less if they died actually scratch that if they died i could have left the cinema earlier everything is a huge clich frames scenes charactersã it almost feels like youre watching a collage and you know exactly whats going to happen every single time this film doesnt surprise you in any way the soundtrack was terribly chosen it gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said lets use it even though it doesnt fit moreover and if im right its not supposed to fit its supposed to contrast with the scenes to make it funny it wasnt thats where it gets ridiculous if this film is supposed to be a parody its not funny at all if its supposed to be taken seriously it fails miserably it did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all not everything is that bad though truth be said the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason im giving it two stars im pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think its great rocket was somehow nice and groot was the one i sympathized more with even though he said the same line over and over for me a film has to tell a story even if doesnt follow convention at the very least it has to express something like every kind of art im tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence of watching films that are 90% explosions cities being destroyed and so on and 10% plot i just felt dumber after watching this its called mass stupidificationwhen i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first told me it was awesome after watching it since then i held my expectations high but i was greatly disappointed to be honest i dont even know where to start the film is a huge clich_ overall and a ridiculous mess starting with the characters and the actors that give them life we have great names in the industry which of course grants the film some status still my only thought about this was what the hell are you guys doing in this film? seriously? renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudofunny acting which doesnt turn out to be funny isnt exactly the perfect recipe i dont dislike zoe saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesnt even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance to provide her character some individuality most of the plot holes if not all of them are found in the main characters whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense one minute gamora was trying to kill peter quill and five minutes later quill was saving her because hes that good just like they are best friends forever after that the love interest feels so so forced becauseó plot thankfully we dont get to see them kissing or whatever otherwise that would be a bigger face palm the background stories are boring with no consistence and so clich_ theres nothing new about them in gamoras case we step onto mary sues grounds the usual wannabe badass whos actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldnt even see in filmsó oh and of course talking about footloose and a lizard fight to extend the length of the film i couldnt feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters so that means they are doing it wrongó the sentimental scenes meant nothing and i couldnt care less if they died actually scratch that if they died i could have left the cinema earlier everything is a huge clich_ frames scenes charactersó it almost feels like youre watching a collage and you know exactly whats going to happen every single time this film doesnt surprise you in any way the soundtrack was terribly chosen it gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said lets use it even though it doesnt fit moreover and if im right its not supposed to fit its supposed to

comfort of my own home with insurgent i was bound to socially acceptable behavior since it was a free advance screening in a theater when i say this is a bad series i truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie the 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine tris shailene woodley against a poorly defined villain and conflict she is even less believable as the brave toughasnails caste member shes been so effortlessly been trying to become and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as divergent? and i thought twilight was awful this second installment centers aroundwell nothing in particular it basically picks up where the first one left off and tris and company have to get back at the jeanine  the out of place cartoon villain theres some magical box thats introduced as the macguffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative dont worry the sequel adds a whole new level of plotholes to the already ridiculous premise gee all that futuristic tech that wasnt in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teengirlturned heroine young adult series characters? development? dont be preposterous those things dont exist in this movie just like the first film you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable that forced romance from the first one? yeah youre just supposed to accept it in this one sorry four youre stuck with her for better or for worse honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clichd movie is miles tellers character hes seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk lets hope no one notices that theyre borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories logans run? thats about a marathon right? nope there are no isolated societies in divergentinsurgent hunger games? no this is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good you must be mistaken oh wait i made it through two and a half pitchers of beer only drinking when there was something generally cringeworthy on screen see if you can beat my record drinking responsibly and in remedy of this movie of course  the best part of the sequel? its 20 minutes shorter than divergent read the

movie angelina pretends to have the accent the three fairies hardly can speak english and the main guy character was so hard to understand that i walked off the movie please announce if you are going to use british accent in movies so many of us would not waste hard earned $$ the movie is predictable the director has spoiled angelinas beauty and there was nothing in the movie that kept my interest we watched the movie in 3d and that is even more waste of money as there were no great special effects worth watching in 3dwhat could have been an engaging cross between james bond and marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity overthetop gore and the ineptitude of samuel l jackson the premise of twentysomethings vying for a spot in a secret society of british super agents is promising but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedyadventure and pulp fictionlike violence colin firth shines as the veteran kingsman and taron egerton and sophie cookson are fine as kingsman candidates but jackson is a lame villain who doesnt have the charm or acting chops to fill his role a movie like this needs a hans gruber and jackson is no alan rickman kingsman the secret service is a good idea with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much betterwhat can i say about this movie that would be positive in some way or form? not much really except for a good performance by rebecca hall as the wife of lead johnny depp i really do not see many redeeming qualities to this film it completely fails at even holding my attention for its full length i will spare you the story since frankly i really do not have the strength or desire to reiterate it to anyone just after having watched the film in its entirety transcendence will leave you with a sensation of pointlessness incomprehension and a complete lack of sympathy for its creators if you are a fan of johnny depp and you think he is so dreamy but dont care much about his acting abilities then this movie is for you on the other hand if you are looking for a good movie with a sound plot and solid character development then steer clear of this disaster of a movie called transcendence you would be happy you didwhat can i say about this film the hype was there very topical a director with an amazing eye all start cast the film should have been very good all round but sadly it is far from it the plot is weak acting poor and the dumbing down of the science has actually led to a film which makes little or no sense who is the audience suppose to connect with? maybe the annoying wife the dead scientist in a computer the annoying friend or the terrible cast of sub characters who all have no substance or any kind of interesting back story if your doing science fiction based around such an interesting and real concept please show some respect to the intelligence of your target audience utter rubbishwhat can be said? the reviewers who love this movie are entitled to their opinion of course but dont trust them this movie is god awful only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting to see it plus the rent one get one free coupon from hastings did it ever come into my dvd player and if ever a premonition of a terrible movie came true it was with this tripe where to start there is no plot but this is just life you say yeah and if i dont want to be entertained for the evening i will not rent a movie i will just stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go by but they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such bs as that did they? who casted his parents? who scripted his lines what a hoax this movie is so bad that when i returned it to the video store this evening and demanded my money back the staff in unison asked did you watch boyhood? we are so sorry this movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this site wow i could go onwhat a silly movie this isã creepy yuppie couple nick and amy live unhappily in the middle of american nowhere for petty reasons amy turns nasty on nick and plan the most incredible and farfetched disappearance act ever seen on screen in fact amy turns into a psychocrazy criminal mastermind committing several acts of violence on herself and others all graphically shown in the movie i guess this is the reason why the rating of gone girl is still so high it does not happen often to see a blond beautiful angelic young woman doing what amy does it is a sort of moralporn of female debasement the plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations ever and by amy and nick deciding to stay unhappily together for reasons impossible to understand just like the rest of the moviewhat a silly movie this isó creepy yuppie couple nick

the worst movies i have ever seen the story makes no sense at all and i couldnt care less about any of the characters the acting was good but the characters were just emptylacking empathy fincher could have killed them all at the same time would make no difference and my god those police officers where incompetent a five year old child would be able to see that there was something wrong straight away she was supposedly assaulted and kidnapped people notice an open door but no one saw her leaving or someone getting inside the house even better drag a person outside put the person in the car in plain day light the amount of blood that she extracted from her body in such a short period would lead her to faint but no she had the energy to clean the place and drive for hours she claimed that she was pregnant and she had analysis to prove from someone else urine even is she had suffered an abortion a few medical investigations would show the reality she claimed she was raped once used the exactly same method a second time and no one thought  wait this is a little bizarre left her place looking exactly the same and no one saw her even with her face all over the news i have no words just horriblewhat a huge pile of steaming poop i could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 92 rating the movie is slow as hell the characters are so badly developed that you never care for them good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after the special effects are pretty weak you see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls but of course they make lots of ugly faces you should see the movie stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects the robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie the plot is just so far fetched that i caught myself smiling at times who let the writer into the cutting room? 3 hours are you serious? only an unabashed christopher nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this practical joke $20000000000 us dollars what a waistwent to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from imdb and my friends some of whom went to see it twice what a disappointment it didnt appeal on any level it was a complete pile of groot humour was limited and shallow plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole its not as if i took the film seriously either i really enjoyed the ludicrous lucy despite its numerous flaws surely i cant be the only one who didnt like this film? if it had been directed by uwe boll it couldnt have been much worse if i never see it again i will be ok glad i didnt waste more time and money watching it in an imax a 12 inch portable black and white would sufficewell well well was this some kind of amateur demo reel? i claim the very dubious honour of having watched thisermovie twice once with a friend and her kids and again with my 14 year old of course its a stinker but then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one the birdpeople for example one method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation people tell friends how bad it is and the friends watch it to see why and ive certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie for a long time twilight was regaled as the worse series ever made i and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation twilight now enjoys a modest cult following another contributing factor is unintentional humour my second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at lavagirls shoddy makeover and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his dance routine for example sometimes deviating radically from the norm can project a film into the realm of cult status also this movie while not engaging in major deviation still has enough tedium about it to give it a little push away that direction who knows perhaps in the future droves of teenagers and maybe adults too will throng to theatres late at night 3d glasses in hand garbage that makes this look halfway decentas they do now for the rocky horror picture show right now the future looks grim for this oddity but i would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the roadwell well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regardswell well  hearing angelina jolie utter those words had me excited maleficent is a sight to behold

awake to the possibilities of what it could have beenwell this was a waste if youve seen the 1992 film the lawnmower man then youve seen a better version of transcendence thats right  jeff fahey outdid johnny depp if youve never seen that movie then you might say this film starts out with a relatively interesting concept however it ends in a twist that doesnt really make any sense based on the actions of the characters in the preceding 115 minutes of the film not one of the characters is interesting or likable the pace of the film dragged and all the members of my party seemed to be waiting eagerly for the film to be over dont waste your time or moneywell theres no chance of letting any spoilers slip because i only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up i can start by saying that i was not a fan of the original series so im not comparing it to anything i just didnt like it i found it very loud and confusing way too intricate and convoluted plotwise i didnt care about any of the characters thats usually the test i give a movie just before i turn it off in the middle how would i feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? if the answer is that i wouldnt care one bit i go ahead and turn it off which is what i did here the three stars are for the special effects which looked pretty good but werent enough to keep me interested for two hours not saying it was a bad movie just saying i didnt like itwell thats 90 minutes of my life ill never get back angelina jolie does her best impression of sucking a lemon as she wanders aimlessly through a plot written on the back of a fag packet the end oh but imdb requires more okay so i wanted to put the princess to sleep permanently  with a hatchet talk about saccharine performance all the secondary characters are pants absolutely no explanation as to why king stefan betrayed his childhood sweetheart for the crown? just like a man thener not utterly built around the lead actress no one else to compete and shes not all that not even close in a wordcrapwell it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends either loving or hating i like to watch movies but i am not like some who seem to be students of film i didnt know going in that interstellar would be nearly three hours or that nolan had directed the film i hated inception also i have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the science in a science fiction film it is in fact fiction however interstellar was just dreadful the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where nothing was established how long had it been since cooper had flown what was his involvement in his previous career? how did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? also i had a problem with the premise that mankind was never meant to stay on earth what? then cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesnt even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour hmmm like others said there is no character development so you dont care about these people the dialog also had a lot of problems i was angry when i walked out i couldnt leave early because i was with someone ugh what a waste of time and moneywe were expecting a new perspective like maleficent huge disappointment we should have realized from the trailers but thats what we get for assuming disney was starting a reboot trend i cant believe my wife leaned over half way through the movie and said im ready to go when you are we were not expecting gore and dismay but we were hoping for a fresh perspective other than adding more footage of the animals if your kids or you have never seen a cinderella movie then its great if youre tired of movies being remade every few years then this is not for you the actors did an amazing job with this rendition however im tired of seeing the same movie over and over with new actors id imagine that its like being a drama teacher in high school first time seeing cinderella = 8 oh nice job cinderella again? = 3 what was disney thinking? so yes the fact that a company needs a revenue income provided by a script that they dusted off from the shelf will flock people to the box office caught us hook line and sinkerwatching boyhood there was nothing to keep me interested i like slow movies in general but if a movie is not exciting it should have interesting characters or good acting or clever writing or perceptive ideas or an intriguing atmosphere or beautiful cinematography or emotional scenes or at the very least make the viewer feel like they are in good company boyhood has none of that it feels long and boring the acting is very wooden the lead seems to have an extremely limited emotional range he can play vaguely amused to mildly irritated and thats about it he even seems to get worse as an actor as he gets older theres no character progression for the main people the lead starts off as a lazy boy and grows into a lazy adult his parents change a bit i suppose but not in a hugely insightful way his dad starts off a transient and ends up settling down inspirational his mom apparently needs a masters degree in order to get a job and begins and ends her scenes in the movie in fits of unhappiness how is she going to find meaning in her life? no one really cares did anyone actually write a script for this film? i know that it supposed to be like real life man but even then it fails two drunken stepfathers? isnt one enough? that mexican guy who because of one patronizing remark from the mom suddenly becomes the manager of a fancy restaurant? even the main guy looked unconvinced in that scene real life has bumps and curve balls dark nights of the soul and moments of extreme beauty and joy in real life people have to deal with hard choices and other people tell stories about these choices called movies with little things called plots and character arcs a deliberately mundane film like boyhood demeans the whole art form of filmmaking whats even scarier is that most people like itwatched gone girl last night  absolute pile of garbage odd film that doesnt know what it is tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it well i certainly didnt no real development behind the break up of the couples relationship  one minute theyre having sex in a bookshop next thing hes lost his job and they hate each other silly things like the way the pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer very contrived  worst case of plot manipulation since crash as for pikes certain oscar nomination its a really bad version of glenn closes routine from fatal attraction blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an oscar performance make best bit in the film was the mistress breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie  to quote the pike character the girl with the giant cumonme tits very astute shame fincher wasnt as perspicaciouswatched 2001 space od instead how can this film get a higher score on imdb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice i can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on also the lead character is so wooden he acts like a 2 by 4 and he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits this would not matter in a proper scifi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter or really it doesnt matter this is over rated tripewas almost not going to give this movie a pass having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess and oh my what a bloated drawn out rudderless and boring bloated mess it was i have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted it was that bad the story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and clich_ dross thrown in for good measure it didnt feel like a scifi more like a soppy drama with a few scifi elements thrown in and the special fx where nothing special a few ok scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland i thought it was going to be an innovative trippy kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes aliens strange technologies otherwordly gods instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members avoidwarning this tvseries may cotain the worst scenes and acting you have ever seen on screen your whole life consider yourself warned i have tortured myself through the first season and ended at the third episode in season 2 arrow is so bad that i would either cut my dick off tape it to my forehead and walk around like an unicorn a whole day than see another episode they copypaste batman the acting is terrible the script is toilet paper the only good thing is the sexiness of laurel katie cassidy how on mother earth did this series got 82 in rating? it is only 03 behind homeland and 05 behind modern family please god cancel this show for the sake of the human race  stayzorvery simple very short the movie is a complete drama i saw the trailers and all of them made the movie appear to be scientific but it is just confusing and filled with speculation i really am getting annoyed with how new movies are all starting to pretend that man is something more like lucy all are disappointing movies and the only parts i really enjoyed was when they showed space like the last few minutes of lucy and the few minutes in interstellar showing the wormholeblackhole etc why do you insist on turning movies into an art? all those who said this movie was great your reviews are really confusing to me how can this be a masterpiece when 95% of the movie was complete drama and a waste of time? if you will make a movie called interstellar i expect to see a 25 hour movie filled with speculation and knowledge about things such as a singularity or a blackhole why waste time talking and docking and other things? just zoom out and let us stare at the blackhole that is the sole reason i watched this movie and the sole reason i created an account here next time change it to dramacomplete drama dont take a name like interstellar and make it into complete nonsense we want to see science we want to see you analyze the blackhole and the wormhole completely low budget stuff were put in this film docking looked fake by the way i am extremely outraged at how fake this movie seemed thank youupon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and i was okay with it if i had known just how much did they butcher the book there would not have been a power on earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket i cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but i will do my best to point out the highlights the performances there is a reason why i gave 3 stars one is for miles teller he is the only bright spot in the entire mess he is witty funny quick and sharp the other star is for shailene woodley her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but i think she did the best she could with the little she got the rest of the cast was a nightmare theo james was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all octavia spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly let alone show off her talent and whoever cast naomi watts must have been drunk out of his senses she is a decent actress but she looked like fours ex wife not his mother even kate winslet was repetitive and uninteresting the writers made both jeanine and evelyn into onedimensional clichs and took away anything interesting about them the story the person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the authors work or the fans there are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered  they are missing altogether you cannot even recognise tris from the book her feeling of guilt is spoken of to the point where it bothers you because she becomes whiny and selfabsorbed yet she runs around firing a gun at anything that moves she is presented as the typical chosen one you have seen a thousand times before and there is nothing original about her journey anymore the only thing i have to applaud are the effects the reason for the third star they are truly stunning even though the are deliberately paraded in the scenes that are made out of extremely thin air the use of special effects is a tricky thing if the story is great you do not need a lot of them just enough to create the environment and underline the story however if there is such a severe lack of originality in the screenplay as you can observe here you notice the precise amount and nature of visual wonders and yet they do nothing to improve the overall impression which in this case is that i could have been doing literally anything else and it would not have been such a huge waste of time i do not normally post reviews because they reflect my own opinion but in this case i felt obliged to save someone the pain of seeing their beloved book torn to pieces and prostituted for profit seriously save yourself the pain i cannot so i am hoping for amnesiaupon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and i was okay with it if i had known just how much did they butcher the book there would not have been a power on earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket i cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but i will do my best to point out the highlights the performances there is a reason why i gave 3 stars one is for miles teller he is the only bright spot in the entire mess he is witty funny quick and sharp the other star is for shailene woodley her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but i think she did the best she could with the little she got the rest of the cast was a nightmare theo james was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all octavia spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly let alone show off her talent and whoever cast naomi watts must have been drunk out of his senses she is a decent actress but she looked like fours ex wife not his mother even kate winslet was repetitive and uninteresting the writers made both jeanine and evelyn into onedimensional clich_s and took away anything interesting about them the story the person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the authors work or the fans there are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered  they are missing

on making liveaction reimaginings of many of their classic animated films i rolled my eyes and thought why would they waste their resources telling us stories that we already know? considering some of the really smart and creative animated films that theyve turned out in the past decade such as tangled 2010 and wreckitralph 2012 it seems like they should be working on more of those on top of that i was quite disappointed with last years spinoff of sleeping beauty maleficent so when i heard that they were indeed planning to keep the trend going with cinderella i was like and so it continues *sigh* however when the trailer came out except for some obvious overthetop cgi effects it didnt look too bad so i decided to make the trip to the theatre yesterday and see it whats the final verdict? well apart from some quite nicelooking sets and costumes disney has once again made another cgiladen cashgrab where its obvious they spent more time and money on how the film looks rather than how the story is executed it seems pointless to summarize the story seeing as its one everybody knows so ill just get right to talking about where the film falls flat its biggest flaw is that while its clear that the writers tried to give some development to the characters by extending their roles andor giving them more interaction with each other but none of it ever lasts for more than a few minutes for example they have cinderella and the prince meet in the forest before the ball in order to try and give them some believable chemistry but the conversation they have only lasts for about ten minutes so it comes off as rather odd when the prince is raving about her and insisting that she come to the ball the next scene similarly we get a subplot near the end that involves the wicked stepmother making a deal with the grand duke that if he keeps quiet about cinderella and raises both her and her daughters statuses she will reward him however the duke almost never speaks in any of his previous scenes so we never get any indication as to why he would betray the prince as he does also there is something that happens near the end of the film which i will not reveal in case you havent seen the movie but its something major that comes completely out of left field and doesnt move the plot forward in any way so its completely pointless the movie also fails in how it constantly tries to show off the lavishlydecorated sets and expensive cgi effects at every turn while they do look nice as i already said they often shove their cgi creatures right into the camera and even have some shots where they zoom in on specific pieces of the set when really they should be focusing on the characters cinderella has really turned me off to all future liveaction reimaginings that disney may come out with if i have to ill get down on my hands and knees and say please please pleeeeease go back to making original content againtrying to remember this is public series started as u would expectand just went downwards there is so much to put the finger onso im just gonna stick to season 3 whats came out anyway question 1 why does oliver arrow behave like hes the only one that have been hurtcan cope with it? 2 why does oliverarrow still mean and enforce that im gonna spare his life no matter whateven though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people that we know of in the seriesbut hey he got to make out++ with a few girls before they diedso conclusion series started out promisingbut hollywood decided to please people to much againmaking it to a lovestory and marvelheroes aint made for such thing truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis the film depends upon multiple concepts regarding spacetime and space travel most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story  but  each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief the series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption so what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be resolved by yet another even more ludicrous outcome this causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses note that the suspension of belief is of course fundamental to many films  in star trek for example one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible  or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable as in inception  and thats aok because the rest of the action is consistent however the number of presumptions you have swallow in interstellar that have no basis in science fiction or reality strains credulity way past breaking point one at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable notwithstanding these comments the individual elements are each highly watchable and nolan does his usual blinding literally in couple of the shots best the environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking however watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas concepts halftheories impossibilities broken linkages and downright wrongness that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale the disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent reality  but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy  possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds  where the original oneline filmpitch made to the moneyboys gets playedout  but its probably too little too latetranscendence had so much potential johnny depp morgan freeman big budget scifi thriller commenting on the evolutionary struggle between man and machine what could possibly go wrong? everything apparently there is no way that a scientist paul bettany whos been off the grid in a cave somewhere for two years could write a virus that would outsmart a selfaware supercomputer johnny depp so advanced over the same time period that it can literally build a human copy of itself from the sands of the earth no way even if the original source code was written by said cave scientist the movie establishes that the supercomputer has been rewriting its code ever since it became selfaware pauls character wasnt even as smart as the human johnny depp and were expected to believe that paul can outsmart johnny as a supercomputer with unlimited resources? sigh and to the subject of national defense a lone fbi agent whos not even a high ranking official makes the decision to side with a known terrorist group to shut down all networks and electricity on the planet? seriously? the united states government or any other world government would sooner take out the terrorist cell and the fbi agent and negotiate with the supercomputer before allowing all hospitals communication commerce defense and refrigeration to shut down in a moments notice and even if we take the premise that the supercomputer committed suicide to save the life of the scientist who wrote the virus why would he do that? he could have easily saved the scientist his wife rebecca halland everyone else by just taking the gun from the terrorist holding the scientist hostage he can sprout nanotechnology from the ground which is how he took everybody elses gun double sigh i was very disappointed again because this movie had so much potential instead of being awesome its just another classic example of poor script writing and relying on big names and special effects to do the job whats worse the makers of this film should have known better shame normally id give this movie a 410 however for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but it gets a 1to this date if i ask someone to explain me in short what is the premise or to provide really a few short details about the story nobody seems to remember or even explain this movie is so easily absorbed from the memory of everyone once you remove all the stunts and explosions you really have no idea what was the story in the first place? the strength of the mi team is precisely in their team the beautiful synergy of unique talents always contribute in outsmarting their opponents we have such a usable cast from beginning what do we do with them? we kill them all from the beginning why? so that entire script story  for lack of the better word could serve one purpose only  tom cruises ego the second movie is what i consider pornography of such exploitation but lets go back to the first one this is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one mans vision everything in this movies serves his own action ambitions that be all fine but it makes me sad that the promise of real mi team was completely destroyed as some have said at previous and im sure will repeat at later date as well  this has absolutely nothing to do with mi seriesto be honest i do not understand how this show has such a great rating it is the worst show i have ever watched cheesy and stupid nothing original ever happens just bunch of dramatic characters i mean how many times will thea cry over the same thing and do something impulsive it happens in every episode they should come up with a better excuse secondly its not sensible the hood does not cover his face its very obvious who he is especially when hes fighting his whole face shows so how can people not realize it i mean if youre gong to make a show about superheroes at least make the watchers fall for it such as batman or spiderman  all of them covered their faces its logic simply terriblethroughout the whole freaking movie i was like damn what a nice movie right there and then it ended in such a way that i want to punch every single retard that had anything to do with the story ending no that is not an inception ending where it brilliantly makes you doubt about the outcome this ending was just plain stupid it was as if at the end of it the writer whispered in my ears ok you paid for it you liked it you waisted your freaking time now get the hell out of this theater as if they lost the budget to fund this movie and they wanted to end working on this movie the sooner possible oh and by the way dear writer for your info why do not play scrabble when we eat octopus whatever what could easily be a massive movie got 100% ruined in just a 5 minutes ending i mean he didnt even sleep with her and u claim this is his child ffs im so mad right now damn youthis year is not very good for the scifi cinematography besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre like xmen days of future past there was actually only one bigbudget movie worth watching on the edge of tomorrow it seems like tom cruise is one of the few hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles his recent achievements leave little to desire valkyrie or knight and day are good at worst with the high pitch of oblivion are we able to say the same about matthew mcconaughey? unfortunately not although his recent movies are above average true detective or dallas buyers club the latest picture he plays in interstellar directed by christopher nolan and written by him and his brother is a huge letdown and misunderstanding i dont think anyone being fond of hard sciencefiction stories will like it here is why firstly the story it is in general similar to mission to mars or the red planet where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission which result will impact the whole human race unfortunately which is the usual problem in this case the whole plot is neither engaging nor entertaining we have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space maybe because of the long time span of the picture the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters besides the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children which is also a timeconsuming thread here anyway the main conclusion of interstellar is the banal statement that love is the most important thing in the world do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? by coincidence the second problem is the length of the movie currently when the the picture is recorded not on the tape but in the digital medium every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might skills or wisdom? i have no idea but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours having the plot for only half of this time this is exactly the case with interstellar the presented story is far from complex and could easily fit in two hours in fact the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences this film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously unfortunately some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy while others are just stupid this mixture makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy such movie impossible to attain on one side we have wormholes black holes higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void on the other hand there is totally unconvincing reality of the xxi century where farmers are more valuable than engineers guys really? and tomography is mysteriously gone in one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole by the way this scene is identical to the one from the far better event horizon in another we see the mission robot tars being the member of the crew i know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today like the one from the day the earth stood still but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in interstellar it is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture its almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of alien 3 the number of errors and nonlogical events is just amazing anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in prometheus which was also much better than this one will have the real hunting ground here in fact the more time passes after seeing the movie the more nonsenses are detected dont think about this too much anyway its not worthy the nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story where the word magic interchangeable with nonsense comes to mind as the result the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters please recall the infamous black hole and you will have the impression of what is going on here the music is of course the extremely important part of every picture if the composer knows his craft the soundtrack complements the images creating the flawless combo as was in terminator starship troopers aliens etc here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him unfortunately it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult people like to go to the movies and see a good story there are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie the mystery the convincing scenery the real characters we could care about finally the emotional strain often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to interstellar does not offer anything of these it is a long and boring sermon about the future of mankind in the universe pretending to be the sciencefiction movie with this picture christopher nolan proved his only memorable work was prestige and the batman trilogy was not the accident but the clear sign that his main achievements in hollywood will be too long boring and utterly disappointing pictures initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema but leaving in a complete sad disillusion after allthis was the best script they could come up with? this was the best idea on the shelf for the backstory for one of the greatest villains? i am appalled strombergs direction was deplorable it was like watching the phantom menace it just made so little sense that i was forced to stifle laughter but failed then they threw in creatures stolen from every creative fantasy artist in the last 40 years and made the world as pretty as avitar i saw nothing new here nothing but money and an exploited fan base maleficent was an amazing villain and this destroyed that wtfg disney you are the george lucas of fairy tales destroying your own creations i will torrent this film when the riff trax boys riff it the least i can do to recoup the money i feel was swindled from methis was one turkey of a sci fi this is my report near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dustbowl corn fields of any midwestern alternate reality the dad is played by mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like seventy through the corn without the slightest bump all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone after stealing the drone mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that nasa really did go to the moon he is chosen by alfred to blast off with catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space stationrocketship after leaving earth they need no longer adhere to primitive earth technology now they can do anything that already ever happened on star trek including cryosleep when they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that stanley and alfred told them about they are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to at least thats plan a there is a plan b but its sub pc and is not going to work for mud who is all about hurrying on up back to earth so he can save everyone gotta say more here about muds robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging hvac ducts that can navigate through zero gravity run across boulder fields and even walk on water not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying after they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on earth wheres einstein when you need him? the whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since catwoman cant swim back on earth the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their oldschool monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dustbowl arkansas muds kids get growed up and environmentally challenged but its really about how mud abandoned them eventually mud and catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dustbowl earth yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers they find a sinister guy who looks like matt damons dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up mud decides that hes gonna take the tin man and fly into the nearbye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away mudbot knows in his crazybrilliant hillbillysage way that if he just makes a bline through the bhole he is going to pop the cherry with hans zimmer in the house mud trips his way through the fivedimensional space after an abbreviated acid trip thanks kubrick thanks trumbull mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library he peers through the stacks at his pastlife capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who cant even hear him if only he could communicate using just his sheer acting meanwhile muds grownup daughter on earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to argo f himself for not joining her in her cave she doesnt like the air quality either so she torches her bros corn crop harsh then she starts moping around in the old family library the very same one that mud is trapped behind the stacks in except muds library is made by humans from the future at least thats what the robot said suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need isó ó wait for itó gravity lots of good opportunities to cry here what with mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left something no idea what clicks and mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the quantum data into morse code so that he can poweremote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on wait did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? it did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravitysignal wiggles coming through the blackhole bookshelf world from her crazy hicksavant dad well that about wraps it up needless to say big daughter transcodes the quantum jiggles into fortran code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to hawaii again years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryonaps in the hope of seeing mud again darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples dont figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to saturn with her tube and her hospital bed a bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed when mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at mud even though he is their great granpappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love more sweet sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate after an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth steal a spaceship and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robotthis was not a good movie as i thought i was expecting as i saw it was so disappointingwhen i watched the trailer i think it will be a blast butt no i sleep in the first 30 minutes of the movie awfuller but i decided to watch because of reviews i think it will be great in the end but no a bogus story no big thing as was expecting as named guardian of galaxy no way nothing wonderfulthe on other hand the graphics are good but remember when you are tallinn about space or rolling in the galaxy their should be some big and huge things and huge monsters like and the base of story line is so much disappointing as you can see that 5 bunch of buddies save the whole universe man thats not seems gud too me their should be a hero like the villain in the movie butt as i say the villain looks terrible but not as he looks looks like mountain from far but a mice from near loland another thing we saw in movie that the 5 buddies escaped the most advanced jail in the galaxy huh?how man how how how this is ridiculous and please hollywood dont waste our time and money to make movies like this okthis was a tom cruise spy film unfortunately it was not a mission impossible film and that was my problem the overall most important element of the tv series was the plot  the heist the robbery the fraud the trickery the whatever the team the brain the girl the technician the muscle and the actor in effect were only there to move the plot forward but saying that we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents a tribute to such excellent actors as peter graves martin landau and leonard nimoy the first thing that this film does is kill off the team disgraceful and then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors drivel and then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of tvs greatest spy master jim phelps terrible sorry but this is not the film that i wanted to see it says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of mission impossible so much as even a silent cameo in this movie imagine the great martin landau as the aged rollin hand what a missed opportunity i think another case of buying a title and doing what you like with it see the saint for further detailsthis truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst scifi film i have ever had the misfortune to waste 25hrs on the acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits the music drowns out a lot of the dialogue which is probably just as well considering its triteness the whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after theyd endured an overkill of everything from the lost in space tv series of the sixties though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings through to 2001 a space odyssey and the innumerable star trek programmes and films any movie that casts michael caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters he utters in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene i lied well he certainly didnt act anne hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that shed rather be undergoing rootcanal work whilst matthew mcconaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he cant quite believe he is expected to say the continuity is confusing and the special effects only reach mediocre adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer i have watched hundreds of scifi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss  but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst this film has no redeeming features whatsoever one develops no empathy for any of the players and there were a couple i longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline the child who portrays the tenyear old murphy to name but one sorry but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on there again you are quite entitled to think otherwisethis show is bad period the only reason is watched it is so that i can bitch about it it has characters and scenes ripped out of batman begins come on with all that budget you could have at least made an effort batman and robin with adam west was more entertaining and one could argue more genuine they had the formula they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids sold but arrow is as lame as they come stephen amell dude nice work with the body building but you could have shaved off some of that hard jaw gritting internalizing stuff he looked like he was constipated most of the time and the man was simply trying too hard to portray oliver queen as a conflicted damaged and deeply hurt it was simply not believable laurel lance oh laurel couldnt one of those arrows accidentally misfired and killed her in episode 1? laurels character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with the audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth the saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of david ramsey who plays diggle and paul blackthorne who plays quentin lance brilliant actors who do it well if stephen amell did not have davd ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off hed be a dead fish floating on the river nile for all one would care i could go on but in all fairness the actors worked hard i give em that the fault really lies with the writing and direction its movie making at its worst the show is forgettable or maybe to be more accurate this show will be remembered only because it is so bad im giving it two stars  one star for david ramsey and one for paul blackthornethis show is almost indescribably bad it makes me angry just to think about caveat i dont know a whole lot about green arrow his name is oliver queen he gained his skills while marooned on an island hes rich and he is so easy to make fun of but this isnt an attack on the concept ive seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting poor directing and writing about on par with the twilight saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences i have ever had and ive seen jersey shore stephen amell as the titular hero green arrow and katie cassidy as laurel are particularly bad with approximately oneandahalf facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger you could make a drinking game out of it truly the writing is staggeringly awful however when i say writing im not speaking about the plot that might yet unravel over time but its too early to tell what i mean is the actual words which come out of peoples mouths there is a specific scene which comes to mind where oliver and his best friend tommy are seated at a table discussing their friendship tommy reveals that hes been sleeping with laurel and olivers only reaction is thats okay i forgive you i closed my eyes for this scene and realized that i could not even tell who was saying what at certain points they have no verbal mannerisms and the funny best friend has no real sense of humor that i could discern plus his jokes plain suck but i guess thats a minor point all things considered i should point out that recently a friend told me that tommy merlyn turns into green arrows nemesis which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times but that doesnt really come across as purposeful on this show the directing is maybe the worst offender here because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining just look at sam raimis work on spiderman 1 and 2 instead i find myself imagining david barrett or john dahl or any number of the other directors on this show sitting there texting while scenes are happening maybe eating a sandwich or something not paying attention must be hungry work im getting into a lot of detail so im just going to cut this off and say that i should have seen it coming just look at the promo picture really consider it that was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series ask yourself what that says about their prioritiesthis review is written after having seen episodes 16 only who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? honestly the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives first off lets get the good things out of the way the plot is very promising and so far its the only thing that keeps me going and the cinematographyeffects are not bad but they could use a little polish here and there especially the choreography of some fight scenes 2 stars from here now what is wrong with this series? they failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero they took the idea of the green arrow and crapped all over it firstly the green arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing with a witty tongue reserved for his foes someone who used to be a very naive young man once but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core so he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon as a modernday robin hood now the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good however his monologues are not as thoughtprovoking philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books i will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorlywritten lines in an arrowlike manner kudos to you sir for actually caring secondly alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot first and foremost is the annoying exgirlfriend laurel whateverhername who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible i can see her thinking trying to remember what shes supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face its like watching a baboon school play the writing of her character doesnt help either we are supposed to accept that after 5 years she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her with her friggin sister and who is responsible for her death? and how about his mother that apparently killed her husband but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched and then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series this is supposed to be a series about a superhero i dont care at all about the sex life of his exgirlfriend i dont care about the sisters drinking problem i dont care about the social life of anyone partly because they fail as characters but mostly because this is a series about a superhero this isnt the days of our lives or sex & the city im not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period im expecting to watch a superhero kick ass bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage dont get me wrong i can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself i like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes what i dont like is the green arrow being a supporting actor in his own series an average episode goes about 40 minutes and 30 of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family then the green arrow steps in the room and says he has to go to fight bad guys but instead of following him we are stuck for another 45 minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them i dont care seriously imagine watching a series about batman that all it does is show catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called clark kent yes clark kent thats how messed up arrow is a terrible effort and an outright insult dont waste your time at least for now its still pretty early in the production only 6 episodes so far and as i said the plot seems interesting perhaps the cw network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season one can only hopethis really is an extremely poor film by any standards obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels memento was absolutely brilliant but christopher nolans films from then on have got worse and worse a distinct case of the emperors new clothes inception was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever for a start it is obvious that nolan went to see 2001  a space odyssey when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further um well messrs clarke and kubrick made a better job of it thats the end of the film written off  dont pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the star wars imagery the main plot is mankind is doomed and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us a few films have done this better there is no money for space exploration apparently but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space please when the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble total recall and it does not get any better as we rerun gravity and 2001 before the starchild repeat plot goes even more haywire then there is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely the space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by gravity so the spectacle is empty and ungripping the actors try but who cares about such an overhyped unbelievable piece of twaddle and s a note to mr nolan jnr  go and watch shane if you want to make a movie about love and family otherwise give us all a rest from your illconceived socalled masterpiecesthis really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd i believe 90% of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewingthis movie would have been better if it was only about tars and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue all that hard science special effects scientists working together making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion this movie is really a cheeseball hollywood film with a hard science backdrop the characters were as flat as a piece of paper the guy likes the girl the daughter is mad at dad dad loves daughter doesnt care about saving mankind even tars had more personality than many of the movies characters the daughter was probably most developed but felt so off still she holds a grudge 30 years later is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful tars gets 1010 rest of the movie 110 i have learned nothing made me think about nothing wasted my timethis movie was way too long scenes were dragged out unnecessarily matt damons appearance was random to say the least and added nothing to the story the plot was weak and made no logical sense this was such a disappointment i cant believe i have seen the same movie as those who have given it 9 stars???? all in all i felt this was a wasted 3 hours of my life that i will not get back this movie was so bad it made gravity look amazing and amazing it wasnt i felt that the music in the film was so loud at times that this drowned out key points in the plot and it wasnt an enjoyable experience straining your ears to try and figure out what was going on in the movie i found it hard to connect with any of the characters which was a let down as i love matthew mcconaghey and anne hathawaythis movie was so boring i literally had to leave the theater before i fell asleep sitting upright i gave interstellar a full hour to get more interesting considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it but i couldnt wait any longer the film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that i could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value the character development was weak the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb the dialog was predictable unimaginative and flat while it did not affect the quality of the film i was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space so people dont have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet earth right now but it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film the first stupid moment was during the lifethreatening giant dust storm scene complete with large chunks of flying debris after the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house huh? another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan stateoftheart space craft apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget less than an hour after he first surprises nasa with his first arrival this pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone no matter how experienced he once was could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed evidenced by no change in the age of the pilots children between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so he almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission this sequence of events had no credibility it felt like some adolescent boys fantasy come true the laststraw final stupid moment was when i realized that the female astronaut played by anne hathaway is wearing fresh makeup everyday including false eyelashes not a big deal considering the major problems with this film but it nevertheless annoyed me what competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? how would several years worth of cosmetics along with false eyelashes even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? how are we supposed to find this astronaut credible? thats when i realized it really was time to abandon the film i was getting downright irritablethis movie was awful i was deceived by the fake rating it was full of pseudoscience so superficial and boring every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional being a phd student in science i envy scifi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by nonprofessional audience such a ridiculous robot underground nasa that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water entering the blackhole unprotected love being the 5th dimension contacting through blackhole by pushing the books oh my can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind dont waist your timethis movie was awful for a number of reasons first it is a terrible story for young kids especially young girls it constantly says that there is no love and the true love kiss is from angelia to the young girl i am all for female empowerment but female empowerment can do better than being anti man second the whole movie was cgi they put almost no effort into making this movie at all disney could have put a lot more effort into making this script and into the costume design plus angelia was super creepy anti fairy tales are all the rage and they can be made well but this is not one of them its ok to have a story that makes you feel good instead of making you feel like garbage at the endthis movie was a complete waste of money and time the supposed rape scene was nothing more than a greedy human being tearing off the limbs of an angel the ending of the movie was completely absurd thank you disney my six year old daughter was heartbroken and crying thanks you ending daddy daddy does this mean true love doesnt exist? of course it does what were you trying to pull with this ending?? my daughter deserved better than some sick twisted fairytale i trusted you disney this is the first movie your company has ever done where it portrays gruesome fighting and killing plus you destroyed any ideas about love and romance in review i thought the movie deserved at least a 410 but my daughter wants me to say 110 so here you go disney 110this movie started out slow but had a typical predictable storyline untilcolin firths character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people singlehandedly the violence was beyond gruesome poles being shoved up underneath peoples chins into their heads stabbings shootings anything you can think of i havent wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but i stuck it out because i was with someone else and figured it couldnt get any worse wrong next thing you know there are microchips overheating and making hundreds of peoples heads explode all to music it was horrendous but wait theres more lets not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him mount her sexist much? are you effing kidding me? i want my money backthis movie reminded me a lot about a book by a guy named thien called the dream chip almost too much like thiens book in the dream chip peoples thoughts and memories are uploaded into a super computer hollywood approximated thiens book the dream chip very very closely in the final cut with robin williams maybe thats why the writers guild of america wga has something called the script registry to protect writers from such unscrupulous behaviors by hollywood studios its probably all just a coincidence or why does the writers guild of america wga have something called the script registry? but this movie doesnt have the strength and guts of thiens book titled the dream chip nor did the final cut thiens book has much more guts too many coincidences for me and way too boring one starthis movie just sucked it was so damn juvenile that as an adult i felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school theres a main underlying premise but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end and the damn thing is about 2 hours long chris pratts character was a ripoff han solo but extremely laidback to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche brosurfer attitude zoe saldanas character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part and that damn raccoon voiced by bradley cooper was more annoying than jar jar binks in star wars this movie rips off star wars in many way down to the retrolike scifi look of the movie half and i mean it seemed like halfit was that boring the movie took place in a prison and nothing really happened besides their dumb escapetrust me it was stupid how they escaped this movie is like watching an incoherent childs illogical dream it is an orgy of impossible childlike fantasy there is nothing in it that made sense and there is nothing that engaged the viewer the antagonist is invincible but wait no hes notthe protagonist is a fragile human but wait no hes notits probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history hell or its probably one of the best marvel comic books are pathetically stupid anyway i hate this movie with a passion and i so regret seeing it do yourself a favor and skip this boring extremely poorly written filmthis movie just made me sad  i was sad for the ruined original story sad because of the terrible writing and predictable plot but most of all sad for all the actors and staff who invested time and energy into this absolute disaster of a movie theres a lot of talent here to work with unfortunately it was all wasted the movie looks fake and fabricated which of course it was there was little real cinematic effort with every environment and most of the characters being cgi there was very little for the actors to interact with as a result we the audience get yet another generic and artificial theme park ride sadly we get so many of those nowadays that instead of making us smile they make us sick i think the movie was ultimately about women empowerment which worked perfectly fine in frozen here though the message was pushed over the idea of true love  a classic motive in almost all fairy tales and child stories so was it worth it ?this movie is supposed to be a movie about life but life is more exiting than that if life were as boring and messed up as represented in the movie the rate of suicides would be much much higher as i watched this movie i expected something to happen but nothing ever did it is as if this movie was intended to make people depressed even the main actor that weird male version of kirsten stewart looked depressed and is it just me or he couldnt articulate properly? extremely irritating youd think that 12 years is enough time for someone to make a masterpiece hahaha as stated on the title ive seen commercials more exciting than that movie i dont think it deserved any oscar nominations the acting wasnt particularly good excepting the father he was the only character that didnt look depressed the story didnt have a plot or anything the movie is as pointless as a circle to imdb why is the rating so high??? 82 seriously???? this movie makes me wish there was a 0 star rating well i guess they can get one star for the effort i normally trust imdb ratings and check them for every movie i ever intend to watch however this rating is waaaayyyy too high for one of the worst movies ive ever had the misfortune to watch it is almost insulting how this movie can be amongst movies like the godfather goodfellas the lord of the rings inception movies that are actually good interesting to watch and a good conversational topic i seriously dont understand this rating out of all the friends and family members that have seen this movie no one has said anything good about it i tend to be positive but this movie is a serious wast of timethis movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clichs and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishthis movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clich_s and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishthis movie is not 1 out of 10 but i have to give this rating so that we can balance its position interstellar tries too much to make you belief it is all about science but the truth is that it is not  i can can say until matt damon appears in the movie everything goes well from that point absurdity and nonsense begin what the hell is a space ship hanging out into a black hole like taking a walk on the street every 3 dimensional object turns into light or energy with black holes incredible and unmeasurable gravity however our full of science movie demonstrates that you can get rid off a black hole with a jet engine  after that scene i realized that this film is way too much more fiction than science what about our hero walks into a black hole at one piece  oops i forget he is into a space outfit it explains everything  this film acts like the gravity movie but in fact its more like star trekthis movie is genius what? seriously? first off possible spoilers although im mostly going to try to avoid them second off seriously??? third its not really a one star movie its like 57ish depending on how you want to weight various factors im just doing this because all the hype and all the stellar pun intended reviews are blowing my mind and need to be balanced out this movie is ok im a scifi geek and an apocalypse movie geek this was kind of supposed to have both so how could i go wrong? easily apparently if you like movies that actually make sense this film is not for you if you have any common sense or a logical brain youll know what i mean when you see it for me this film falls into the big flashy substance free summer blockbuster category aside from the fact that it was released in fall if you like big flashy special effects movies with no substance youll probably love it because youre ok with just going for the ride if you like movies that make sense and have cohesive plots you will likely be irritated when this strays from those lofty goals and stray it does a lot he tried to make a great movie but ended up with one that doesnt quite get there this movie like so many movies with generally promising plots falls down all over the place in the execution or more specifically the script itself special effects were killer with lots of great visuals all the directing portions of the movie were well done so i suppose i can say nolan did a great job directing the movie all the actors were just fine the problem was with what they were told to act out so nolan did not do a good job as writer perhaps he should stick to directing which he is quite good at let me say this im not a pompous arrogant guy in real life but sometimes i wonder if having a couple dozen iq points over average just ruins films for me so many movies have everything this one does good basic premise good acting great special effects horrible scripts that make absolutely no sense for anyone with a brain so where to begin? in my opinion a huge percentage of movies especially scifi require that you accept a basic premise many of them do not make sense this can be ok you just have to roll with it even if its a little off think zombie movies i love zombies but really with the setupexplanation of how most zombie viruses spread and how awesome our military is and how slow zombies are or even if theyre fast zombies its a ridiculous premise the mess would last about a week and then get under control how exactly does a zombie take out an abrams tank again??? but i roll with it this movies basic premise is slightly flawed but not so much so that it has to completely ruin the movie there are cases where the basic idea is so bad i cant get past it but this isnt one earth is basically overwhelmed by bad weather and crop killing plagues it happens in real life the dust bowl was rough and so was the irish potato famine the truth is that we could deal with those easily on earth but let us pretend we couldnt and move on my problem is with the endless series of things that either outright dont make any sense or things where you have to stretch it pretty far mentally and basically cover up for the writing by buying into implausible silly reasons for things how exactly does everyone still drive around gas guzzling trucks and yet are enthralled by a few small solar panels they can pull off of a uav? how do they have all this infrastructure for pointless things yet they cant keep control of said uav or like make parts for their robotic farm equipment they rig up from scraps? thats the first like 2 seconds of the movie this movie is a death of a thousand cuts going point by point would take way too long in my opinion this movie didnt have any deal killer plot holes as in no one thing completely made my head instantly explode but what did happen was by the end of the 2nd hour there were so many little silly things piling up that it just went beyond the pale theres plenty to be desired in terms of the time dilation stuff making sense but most of it does if you think it through logically and do the math perhaps not 100% though to me it just had a general vibe of meh with a lot of little stuff then theres the non logical portion of the story aka the human story also being meh its like they kind of want you to think cooper and brand had a love thing maybe? or at least cooper does for her but then no development but then he rushes off at the end after her is that a platonic hero thing or was that supposed to be the big romance story? you dont even know because it was such a mess its not that the actors couldnt have acted it out fine but it just doesnt happen i found myself not really caring about any of them much because none of them were developed cooper was a pretty cool dude but other than that i didnt take a lot away thats it im done typing in short feel free to watch it but just be forewarned if you have an analytical mind that you will find many portions of the movie causing minor brain aneurysmsthis movie is based on clichs all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable good performance of some actors you start getting into the boys life but this hope just fades away as the movie develops as extremely unexciting imagine a boring life of a boy living in the usa translate that into a 3 hour movie but taking away any potential exciting moments the ones with adrenaline interesting intellectual reflections sex etc etc thats what this movie is i am usually not that bold in criticizing movies but this one deserves it sorry but it does even the 10 minutes i watched of sharknado were better at least it was a bit funnythis movie is based on clich_s all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be

time so pathetic pretentious wannabe philosophic nolans puke with terrible acting nothing more than that are people becoming this dumb to find this movie actually good? i could not find anything in it that would touch me move me it was just so empty without any wow moment except maybe the water part what was the point of this movie? i feel it has none  maybe just to make money as that is the point of life we live for these days love as a premise is ok but it just got waisted in this one sorry to all who liked it but something is going so wrong in hollywood i feel so embarrassed for the movie industrythis movie is a darn shame for its poor ability to tell a story and i am a bona fide scifi lover this movie is a pale imitation of 2001 a space odyssey from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant scifi background scratching their heads and asking themselves what did i just see? what did it mean? plot synopsis earth is dying a slow ecological death the dust bowl is back bigger and badder than ever crops are failing one by one all we can grow is corn and you know what happened to ireland when it tried monoculture the potato famine earths only hope is to send expeditions through a black holewormhole thats conveniently appeared near saturn in the movie 2001 the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane homicidal computer in interstellar the missions hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole to achieve this mission a nasa gone underground sends the wobbliest spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot the space vehicle thats sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole it takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole the special effects and cgi are probably very good in this movie but seeing it in imax presented two problems first the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large second its impossible to take in the entire screen you must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmakers emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen this appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in imax and i keep forgetting about this problem i really wanted to like this film i didntthis movie is a complete joke the only thing going for it is the visual effects in the 1959 disney classic maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all also i want to write in some details why i did not like this movie and why the story was very weak in my opinion first why is king stefan evil? why did he send aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots the good fairies are idiots? and prince philip is not the true love of aurora? what nonsense finally the motherly kiss of maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place and finally maleficent kills stefan auroras father and aurora is happy about that? what the hell? really a silly movie i gave it 210 just because of the cgi which hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and castingthis movie has received unanimous acclaim from critics and is hugely popular with practically everyone else and i really cant understand why for me it fails to do the one thing a movie absolutely has to do  entertain it looks like a film studies exercise a technical achievement for sure but not a film made with the viewing public in mind for starters the near enough three hour run time is excessive to say the least boyhood is an unusual film that could end at any time during it and feel no less complete than the final cut this is what is baffling to me why couldnt they have started with mason a little older? or finished a little younger? it would still be as bland an ending as we ended up with there were opportunities within the film to elaborate on some of the plot points that arose for example the dinner scene with the lecturer as masons stepfather and its aftermath or in particular the all too brief part when he was confronted by a group of kids in the bathroom did we see how this affected mason as a person? did we see how he resolved the problem? no it was completely ignored and we continued at the horribly slow pace which still relentlessly ploughs on regardless of any potentially interesting events that may occur and finally perhaps the most irritating part of this film mason himself i cant understand why a film centred so heavily around a single protagonist would write a character to be so bland and unlikeable he spends the first half of the movie watching the mundane unexceptional world and people around him saying and doing nothing  i know hes just a young kid but he may as well not even be there the second half may be even worse as he goes from being a bland lifeless child to a completely unlikeable young adult he talks like he knows everything about life which at his age he clearly doesnt and makes a halfarsed attempt at becoming a photographer by going to college great nobody cares yet somehow they drag this out for as long as most other films last in total thankfully the movie ends rather abruptly at this point the movie may well be like real life but why is that entertaining? for a film centred on one characters life to work their story has to be interesting or unusual a film about an emotionless kid growing up to be an emotionless teen is as boring as it sounds linklater deserves the directing oscar for sticking by a project for 12 years and having such an original idea but the final product has wasted three hours of my life and if you havent seen it yet i really wouldnt waste your timethis movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it first off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days with what i assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was when a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a ken burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way we have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and i say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe the second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon space and beyond anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked the last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when mathew mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bedonly to chase him out of the room then there are the million questions that dont add up there is no army any more lol like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn and where did nasa come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no us government to build all this crap? its a known fact that the scientists at nasa built not a darn thing nor ever have its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them nasa does not so much as put one bolt in one hole micheal cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning damn that geritol is working good this movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like contact you will learn to swear after leaving if you dont know it will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and dont care or understand content or plot and by the hippie eco nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers do not waste your hard earned money on this loserthis movie fails to show why a remake was necessary it fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall it also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one hollywood star the femalefemalerelationship as central point rather than the male femalerelationship is nothing new since frozen in fact prince philip who is even more onedimensional than his cartoonversion is still there at the end to be the one and only considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between auroras real parents and adoptive parents just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about auroras mother dies offscreen and nobody not her husband not her daughter ever seem to take any notice just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie not only the queen and the young prince are loosing screentime and depth the three good fairies in the original had personalities while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor the third fairy never actually was able to give her wish the movie never explains this plot whole maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of angelina jolie in a movie about angelina jolie no character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought they are all background for more angelina jolie overall i am deeply disappointed if you compare the old sleeping beauty with the new movie you can see the disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing dont watch it with your children they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies dont watch it for the sake of nostalgia because its unable to provide the same quality it used to before 3d was able to overcome any plot wholes and dont watch it for the sake of crafty 3d the same expected shots of flying sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again you will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitivelythis movie based on an amazing book and was drawn into a dramatic and hyper realistic screenplay by spielberg before that script was ultimately butchered into this movie by christopher nolan read the summary of the original script  it is such a good idea for a movie space sex? how cool what we have with interstellar is crying in space every character gets at least one long crying scene its too much the soundtrack is repetitive and exhausting the dialogue is bland the backstory is weak and i could go on but none of this is my real grip with interstellar i think the movie is unrealistic but not in a physics of space isnt real enough kinda way  which is the complaint most people have when saying this movie is unrealistic i thought the characters were unrealistic i just couldnt believe that they believed we hadnt gone to the moon in a day when traveling to saturn as a species is possible i couldnt believe that matthew mcc would be so emotionally weak yet be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and an expert pilot i couldnt believe the length that the characters would go to in order to deceive eachother now for the technology  i am okay with it being a little off but the inconsistency is what is tough to swallow but you saw regular normal ol saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth yet they could zip around near a black hole with gravity 8000 times that of earth with tiny little engines? they have artificial intelligence capable of reliable and supercomplex reasoning with extremely strong limbs and they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?this might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is something documentaryish about the shooting of certain scenes like what you see in natgeo i cant seem to pinpoint the exact thing about it that ticks me off maybe it is the contrast coupled with the extreme clarity of the whole film anyway it just doesnt seem appropriate because it gave the whole movie a boring and lackluster feel most importantly i am so disappointed in the actors i love johnny depp but his character fell flat throughout the film he isnt a character i want to know more about and i cant detect any real sense of affection between the main couple their acting feels amateurish and johnny depp just lost a fan congrats i cannot bring myself to watch the whole thing because i just lost interest after he became a computer you might think thats when things get juicy well it didnt it got even more boring and clich basically the movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiringthis might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is

dont watch it its uninspiringthis is without exception one of the dumbest films i have ever sat through or perhaps its a masterpiece and im too dumb to understand it? anyway  here are some of the things the list is not exhaustive that i could not get my head around there is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world and the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says oh well dems the breaks and does nothing seriously? apart from that one dude in the super secret nasa compound? okay then a super intelligent super advanced alien civilization has been watching us they see that the planet is in peril that more than six thousand million people will die from starvation so they offer a solution not by curing the blight mind no that would be far too easy they construct a wormhole they being five dimensional creatures n all close to saturn cos kubrick had already used jupiter in 2001 the film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight cornmash beer anybody but its only a matter of time before that too succumbs so its a matter of great urgency that the astroheroes get to the ol wormhole as quickly as possible so the far side of the moon would be a handy place to put it no no noooo they place the wormhole beside saturn so distant from earth that it takes two years just to fly there and all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at pharming college anybody for cornflakes? now nasa have already explored the wormhole they know that it opens into another galaxy beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on earth while back on ol planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace so this was the plan? by the super intelligent aliens? is someone taking the p*ss? there were no planets anywhere that were  um  not right beside a black hole? super intelligent? doh and so finally after a number of silly subplots our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole my god its full of stars? and experiences time as a physical construct but is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? hell no he is shown his daughters bedroom on the day that he left on his weekend getaway we see him getting really upset that his daughter isnt picking up on his stay  stay gravity assisted message even though he should remember that she shouted stay  stay to him on that day and he left anyway sheesh and zimmers soundtrack? i hadnt heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email without him ever seeing the movie explains a lot really presumably the email went something like if you produce anything orchestral like kubrick youre off the project so the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven in the cinema where i watched it piercingly loud quasi classical discordance bear in mind that kubrick chose the pieces by strauss etc to assist him in editing the movieand then realised that they actually fit perfectly and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned not nolan nosirreebob email it in hans who listens to the music anyway? deeply deeply disappointing and i loved inceptionthis is weird i love science fiction and i love astrophysics but disliked everything about this movie the start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake the second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap ripoff of space 2001 the movie just didnt do it for me at all and the acting was average im totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10 maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality storyline plot acting and uniqueness  as this movie doesnt have any of it ah well i guess ill just have to wait for the next sf movie and hope it will be somewhat better because i am deeply disappointed by interstellar as i expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 millionthis is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized people are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews let me tell you this this movie is really not that great first its too long it takes one hour just for the space mission to start its slow paced and very sentimental or in other words most of it is boring im not an english native speaker but my english is not bad either i have no problems watching movies in english and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main characters mumbling in his farmer accent all other actors spoke properly except him the most important one the plot is not very logical planets just in front of a giant black hole? yes this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you ok were now ready to fly down to that planet you wait here dont worry well come back soon in some years youd probably smile and say wonderful ok go now right? one day they come back and are probably surprised to see you havent committed suicide because of depression even though you waited 23 years  for them you must be the most patience man in the entire universe and again a female scientist who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur an obligatory part of every scifi movie nowadays this is just to give you an idea there is much more so read the other negative reviews good night and good luckthis is the emperors new clothes all over again the movie runs two hours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years and believe me it seems like 12 years there is nothing of interest in the film it is about nothing nothing happens except children grow up parents grow up children make friends parents marry again and again no drama no humor no sadness no happiness just boring people leading boring lives and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow is just that a gimmick the boy of the title is a slacker seeking meaning by doing nothing save your money and more important save your three hours and see another movie any other moviethis is the dumbest movie i ever watched i felt insulted by it there is no discernible logic the script seems written by 1000 monkeysd its a pity they did this because the idea could have lead to a very intriguing and interesting story but they wasted it i didnt even worry to watch it to the end i left the theater and drove home they even wasted good actors they seemed so bored they didnt even pretend to act what were the producers and the director thinking? my recommendation dont waste your time watching this  read a book insteadthis is the biggest disappointment ive had at the theater in a long time even worse than noah the idea was outstanding with the flavor of 007 james bond from live and let die days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor everyone i know wanted to see this movie then they put in more cussing than scarface and more blood than kill bill and drowned it in a hard r that left the audience stunned and confused if this movie had been a pg13 for the family it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks instead they made fun of rednecks and republicans used the fword as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie had scenes that were so brutal and outofplace in this funny little movie that i looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes they drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood if you are an 18 year old marine or just out of jail enjoy if you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies skip this sleazy piece of poopthis is one story i was told as a child which is totally destroyed by this movie something told to children by generation of parents totally twisted kiss of true love? no prince no dragon? it seems that nothing in this world is immune to free love movement i do respect everyone but some things should stay as they were whats next snowwhite is kissed by a witch who was always good inside? hansel & gretel were two boys? princess returned glass slipper to cinderella and they lived for ever and ever? on the other side acting effects sound everything is excellent but i do think it should be another story all by itself disney its a shame what you did with this epic story just to be in the flowthis is one of those movies that should not have been made it is basically a d rated story with scifi thrown in to sell tickets the science is horrible so it only acts to aggravate scifi fans who assumed they would get something that is at least half researched so how is it bad? lets see they build up ai as something superhuman only to find out that it is easily foilable with a simple computer virus written in a matter of hours by a few hackers the authorities decide to collude with terrorists to combat a future perceived threat that has not actually committed any sort of crime the terrorist are basically your run of the mill antitech revolutionaries with brains the size of toe nail clippings and all happen to be scientists themselves the movie cheapens science and scientists considerably making them appear petty brutal and plain stupid which is actually incredible offensive to those who worked hard to achieve something in the field skip this movie just watch a cheap mexican soap opera it will be time better spentthis is one of the worst films in recent memory everything about it was terrible the score the acting the characters the dialogue and the absolutely ridiculous and insulting holefilled plot do not waste your money on this garbage it will only make you angry not a single note of this film rings true nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible spoilers the pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it not really sure why they dont check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911 she got in a car covered in blood and drove to another state to be with her husband who  according to her own diary  she believed hated her and wanted to kill her writing this and having to remember this stupid film is making me angry again im gonna stop dont go see this garbage watch body heat instead it is way betterthis is not the worst remake in film history i have never understood the idea of a remake at all if an anime like cinderella monogatarie is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? if you insist on tampering with perfection why then do you have to try to recreate it in its whole? there is nothing original here kenneth branagh put nothing of himself into this film they say imitation is the highest form of flattery but this is ridiculous there are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as cindarella and i suspect that branagh may have wanted to explore them instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap liveaction imitation of the popular anime in the end kenneth branagh set out to pay homage to a great anime instead he cheapened it and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cablethis is my first review and i am compelled to write it t counter all the 10 star ratings this is possibly the worst movie ever made i fell asleep several times and would have left had i not been sitting in the middle of the row of seats i wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film its just boring and nonsensical why is every actor in the movie crying all the time? why does mm mumblewhisper all his lines? i felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and didnt care if they lived or died i heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrementthis is it these parody films and wannabe spy genre films has got to stop because this is what ruins the original franchise and makes fun of it shame on these people i cannot even dream about someone making fun of sean connery and his bond but people did it the reason is no person on this earth is cool as him sean is not a actor but the definition of man itself period however this film makes fun of pierce brosnan 007 era films with exploding pens and gadgets etc brosnan is a boss he redefined spy genre the makers of kingsman should be sued for this blasphemy i dont care if it is rated r or pg 13 i saw this film and i got angry specially with sir samuelljackson i lost respect for him i mean how is this classic method actor can do this film from pulp fiction to pure pg 13 garbage stuff i got exited when i saw him being funny but by the time climax came his death scene is the funniest moment in the entire film he was embarrassing himself just what the hell is going on these days is hollywood running out of ideas they have same story lines over and over again repeating same thing million times what is wrong with these people kids with guns using bad language and violence for no reason even killing animals what a shameful era we are living in let me clear this up a bit this is not a snuffporn or exploitation film filled with sex but even those have some bloody standard at least they are serious about it and makers know what they are making but this one is nonsense mathew vaughn made just one good film in his life probably his last best too it is called layer cake with daniel craig check that out guys if you have not but avoid this crap please the plot let us look at the plot here it goes as a spy agency hires kids so they can battle evil villains who are about to destroy the world oh please why drag kids and teens into this kids already ruined wrestling attitude era this is coming from a 90s kid batista and john cena acts in lame movies too because they still aim it for kids ala guardians of galaxy etc parents are proud of it but the hypocrisy is that people hate kristen stewart and dakota fanning when they do goo serious dramatic films special vfxcgi effectsgore goes useless the dialogs are so cheesy it makes cartoon network looks like history channel this is high time minus point this film looses it people are asking for a refund me too but who will listen if films like these are still coming out whatever this is hollywood or british production it is the direction sucked big time so my question with critics and people is how dare all of you hate john wooang lee & ridley scott these guys are legends and their movies are gold hey even a tinto brass movie is better then kingsman any day colin firth was crazy for cash yes there are some hot sexy women here but wasted for people who want a great spy film watch mi22000 or for comedy try rush hour 2 as for action go back and try drunken master or matrix trilogy even but stay way from this guys dont believe the hype critics are blind i am waiting for bad boy 3 michael bay will show these kids how real action is done overall kingsmanthe secret service 2015 is the worst film of 2015 my rating is 110skipp it save your money & time please i have wasted minethis is by far the worst movie of 2014 character development doesnt exists in this movie nor any interesting dialogs or any real suspense moments the plot is dragging way too long and doesnt reach any climax if the film would have been 90 minutes long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture the film score is irritating and dull which suits the banal script just fine i dont remember when was the last time i left the theater so angry and bored before watching this movie just stay away from this banal piece of nothingthis is an attempt at giving sleeping beauty the wicked treatment tries and fails dismally first of all the magic kingdom is fantastic with lots of bright cgi forest dwelling folk frittering around the screen this will be enough for most small children to get their moneys worth above that this film is awful the plot does not work on any level now i know this is a childrens fairy tale no one is rewriting shawshank here but the story is so awful it is insulting to the intelligence of infants basically the producer has gone down a check list of standard movie elements so we need a flying scene a battle scene a magic forest a princess check check  check check then at the last minute someone remembered they had to hammer the whole thing into an alternate sleeping beauty small children will be entertained by the graphics adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story i was left wondering  given the true turn of events  who is propagating the version of sleeping beauty we all know anyway?this is a truly awful movie that cannot be related to on any level a total waste of a famous cast what an absurd story a dying man uploads his mind onto a computer then some nonsensical fighting ensues between those who are for and against such things johnny depp doesnt need to do such bad movies stoned faced performance by the way rebecca hall too unattractive for the lead female morgan freeman needs to display some selectiveness cillian murphy and paul bettany dont know what you were fighting for this type of bad sci fi rubbish has got to stop it deserves to be forgotten like it was never made at all makes inception seem logical by comparisonthis is a true zombie fest the undead have made a television show and to underline this i ask the question does anyone ever stay dead on this show? i mean how would we know anyway? i imagine if i was a zombie this would be the show to try out for or perhaps as the show runner or as a writerswooden stumbling desperate i suppose if youre watching this on tv the commercials would come as a relief or perhaps the zombies are holding families of the writers hostage and making them write this show makes sure the most wooden actors possible are cast or the best actors at acting really badly again its on netflix which is usually a pretty good sign that it will be pretty awfulthis is a formal request to matt damon matthew mccougnehey christopher nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back i warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie dont this movie is riddled with plot holes a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote if you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen there is little room for surprise and even less room for enjoyment adding to this the visuals in the movie are a huge problem in watching it i got a headache and motion sickness so not only was i left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema i also felt physically ill i feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones and the acting feels very forced and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it i would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the room with tommy wiseau or gigli with ben affleck and jennifer lopez because i think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame interstellarthis has got to be the most overrated show in the history of tv series the idea at the beginning of this show was great but the character of oliver is awful how can the writers let this be like that? did they ever read the comics? oliver queen was a joyful character with a lot of jokes that was special about him that even if he lost a lot he still had the power to smile and make funny jokes all of this just makes the show bad from the start instead we see a robot with no personality that falls in love with anyone anytime season 1 was ok but it was obvious that it was mediocre at best and that was written by people who knew nothing about writing a good screenplay the worst part was that they kept that my name is oliver queen thing and previously on arrow although every episode apart from the season finale had no connection what so ever with the other episodes except the characters another bad thing was the obvious made up as the show went on thing the writers were always changing the story so that the story on the island could fit and be the same like the one from the present it just doesnt feel right and this cant be just a coincidence probably the best argument for this would be the episode from season 2 when oliver caught sarah and the first thing he remembered was how she drown with the yacht in the beginning of season 1 really? shouldnt he remember the last thing that happened between them that got sarah killed can no one else see that? are the writers so stupid to contradict themselves always when they need to introduce someone new to the show the finale was stupid stupid seeing at the end that oliver was transported in hong kong from the island and somehow he made it back really? am i supposed to buy this? i can guess that at the end of third season there will be another person like amanda that comes and take oliver back to the island or some place else thats just obvious made up on the way people about the mirakuru i have nothing to say except another contradiction a very convenient coincidence that on the island oliver had a cure and in real world he had again a cure for slade it just feels stupid that all the show is centered about oliver making choices between right and wrong its just like a propaganda next when slade soldiers were encountered first by oliver he couldnt even hurt them but in the end he fights them like they are usual people although detective lance was seriously injured by one of those thugs how can no one see this contradictions in the show? are they so well hidden or only the brainless are watching the show right now probably because there are few votes for each episode and only high ones from those who think the show is good but in reality people with brain left the show a long time ago if the writers want to make a link between the present days and slade from the island why cant they show something else and then in season 3 or four show how slade got injected and became so bad watch lost and see how some things are left unresolved and then the writers show how everything happened and surprise you but here there is no surprise you know that oliver did something to upset slade and youre just expecting that bad bad and bad i have nothing to say about this stupid show that had potential but it was destroyed by stupid writers in the future if you want to see a good hero movietv series watch one that portrays well the comics and is real in what can it be like the dark knight trilogy the writers from this show decided to destroy another show the flash and i strongly recommend that you dont watch that either 110 totally awfulthis had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately you cant stop there story pacing supporting cast winning characters? oops ¾ we blew the budget with ajs wings and the cgi so so  is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you dont even care what happens?? if good conflict is what drives a good narrative does the absence of any good conflict  very much the case with this plodding slackly handled drearathon  make a bad one? the worst thing about this which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth is that in redeeming the character of maleficent they decide to depict that she wasnt a mean old spinster she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted its so schmaltzy its kitsch im a guy and this stuff offends my paltry feminism considering some of the takenoprisoners characters that aj plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kids movie is bad just take a similar movie enchanted  which had great songs a fantastic cast a charming funny sweet and complex story it is rated at 72this had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately

mi movie was bad enough as it was now that we are on mi 12 or something like that it just makes it worse most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done great movies thus i have to wonder were they improving in this piece of crap? was de palma just like meh f*ck it let the special effects guys write this garbage dont get me wrong tom cruise is an awful actor anyway but christ it was a socalled all star lineup if it wasnt touted to this day as a good movie i wouldnt comment but this sh*t will not end kill it already in my opinion if you havent seen this movie consider yourself luckythis film sucked on every level imaginable from the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography the directing the editing the flow the lack of transition the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography    oops  my keyboard momentarily slipped into a transdimensional time altering state of flux that actually made more sense than anything about the film interstellar actually the film sucked with a force far greater than any gravitational pull exerted by a black hole that it literally pulled any intelligence out of the minds of the films viewers thereby destroying any rational or true cognitive ability to make a sound review of this really really really great film i want my mommy   this film is tripe synonyms  cheese crapola dreck muck rubbish sleaze slop slush trash related words  camp kitsch claptrap humbug nonsense bomb clinker clunker dud lemon stinker turkey mess muddle shambles the one good thing about this movie is that it made me want to view stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey again not even imax saves this film and an 89 rating here is proof that hollywood owns imdb youll be better of getting your reviews from rotten tomatoes because this movie isnt at all fresh christopher nolan you had me with inception but you lost me here please leave the blockbuster drama to steven spielberg and the planetary sci fi to ridley scott & james cameron thanksthis film is mostly just a video game without the controller there wasnt enough of the story to explain who the characters were it just jumps right in the scenes and dialogue happen very fast the villain was yet another classic villain who only does things because hes the bad guy and he likes dark places and wears spooky clothing because hes evil there is another villain who shows up in the movie who is presented as being badder than the main villain but then never shows up again this made no sense the characters rocket and groot added a little humor here and there as well as the other main characters but thats pretty much what all of the movie was there was no real sense of danger because at every twist and turn the heroes would solve it within five minutes or whatever even very very very big spaceships with giant laser beams approaching a planet felt like no danger because it always seemed that the heroes could handle it this is the problem with most action movies nowadays every thing in it is made to be epic and amazing movie viewers all around the world are constantly being shown movies with things that are specifically made to be epic and amazing that incredible cgi and other special effects begin to seem mediocre and they get used to it so much that nothing seems to amaze anyone anymore because every action movie is made in that way theres no more star wars kind of effects on audiences where they are thrilled by something new and creative this movie is mostly just a big show to dazzle spectators with special effects that you have to look very carefully to find any good storytelling in the film there has to be a balance between good story telling and good cgi in a film like this but instead this film is nothing but constant cgi explosions and cheesy oneliners that we begin to forget what the story is or why things are happening however the plot was extremely simple the villain had no sense of having a specific reason why he wanted to rule the galaxy all the characters are introduced too fast that we dont get used to them or relate to them the movie is like watching a video gamethis film is an antiintellectual zenith it is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity i have never seen such sf movie full of nonsense at least in the last 20 years every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to hollywood pulp ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago medeagaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale pseudo philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multidimensional timespace is simply ridiculous situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon i can only say serious case of ignorance and standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldnt be allowed to make a sf movie really bad choice i am disappointed very disappointed 1 point is for the robots best regardsthis film glorifies sodomy it mentions global warming as if its a real thing it implies strongly that margaret thatcher was not a positive political figure it portrays christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter the foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think its clever or what point it is theyre trying to make by taking that road there are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto the plot is full of holes i could go on but suffice it to say that this is lowgrade filmmaking and a waste of everyones time my wife and i both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon backthis dreary  boring  depressing  and overly long scifi flick is about the dying earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings  unless you are stephen hawking or neil degrasse tyson or you possess a degree in quantum physics  thermodynamics  time warps  black holes and worm holes you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with  to make matters worse matthew mcconaughey is probably the best mumbler in hollywood  i did not understand a single line that came out of his face  anyway the great dust bowl of the 1930s has returned to wreck havoc on the world only this time it really means business  matthew mcconaughey  the worlds greatest astronaut turned farmer  is chosen to be the earths savior  his interstellar space craft endurance is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time  it is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions  collisions  and a gigantic tsunami wave 1000 feet high  anne hathaway is the cryogenics expert  she looks a lot more convincing playing catwoman than the endurances genius co astronaut  this movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an iq of under 140 to comprehend  interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours  i would recommend george pals 1951 scifi classic  when worlds collide  over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk   not hot pwhthis does contain a spoiler one that if i would have known i wouldnt have wasted my time or money i dont like to even watch trailers on movies because i want no preconception of how a movie is going to be this movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking i thought the story was very well written and acted despite almost always knowing what the twists were going to be until the pace was so slow and could have been compressed into a normal 7585 minute movie my guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they ran out of time for dragging it on like they did when the credits hit the entire audience i was with pretty much let out a stream of obscenities and we all felt like the producersdirectorsstudio all just gave us two middle fingers i could have dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the moviethis back show is terrible they have the spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents which plays well to the obamaera class warfare but little else the core seems to be if you got rich you did evil to get there really? he cant fight crime he has to be on this vendetta crusade? plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode couldnt just tell us the back story in one episode? this is such a disappointment after smallville was brought to the network i had a hard time watching it bad scripts bad plots and acting that would do 1966 william shatner proud all top this offthey stole the entire movie from orlando corradis version of cinderella which was fantabulous creation i never knew they were such cheats guys do check out orlando corradis anime version of cinderella and youll know all theyve got whole storyline running from there its just that its not an animation this time orlando corradis version is really old one they needed peoples attention and praises so cheated whole thing from someone else how cheap isnt it? corradi is no more i guess but still i think his works are worth an applause maybe its just because am a big fan of animes but this is too much never ever gonna watch this disneys version i feel bad for corradithere is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as on screen heads are exploding limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex the film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist but then at about the midway point things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible this is not just movie violence but violenceporn violence for laughs violence that glories in being shocking and over the top the movie itself in terms of filmcraft is disposable and forgettable but what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what ive just watchedin the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined british spy agencyis a marker of the decline of western civilization kingsman is the roman circus for the 21st century and every bit as brutal and pointlessthere is nothing good about this movie the television show had a format this movie takes the name of the show but does not follow the format at all the television show was fun but this movie is slow and boring and has no likeable characters i do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television showthere is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real this was hands down the worst movie experience of my life it made shark boy and lava girl seem like a masterpiece both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same sonalbeit almost a decade apart i cannot believe i ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hellfest i alternated between scratching my head holding back laughing wanting to yell out jokes about lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater we all shared the same sentiments go ahead blow $10 on this miserable ridiculous implausible pile of poopy that would make m night shamalyan scream out you have got to be friggin kidding me at the movies attempts at plot twiststhere have been too many versions of the movie cinderella and this modern version was so disappointing indeed it is made for kids only and not for adults the movie was so boring walt disney pictures did not offer anything new in this dull and outdated sequel the remake was much worse than copy and pastea lot of imitation of cinderella movies and nothing original walt disney stole all the ideas and movie plot from orlando corradi see orlando corradis cinderella movie and see the shocking evidence how disney is clever in rip off & theft the acting is so tasteless see the original version and avoid this imitated versionthere box in the book i dont why it was even in there i just added more confusion next her hair cut was awful  i know fault in our stars she couldve kept the wig from the beginning of the movie next they barely include side characters  christina hector etc  dont expect anything from the book jeanine doesnt get killed by evelyn but by tori what is sad is that peter and eric were my actors then all start randomly running towards the fence after as if they are all gonna get out  which doesnt happen  then the jeanines army randomly go in amity in the beginning with barely any marcus evelyn standing on the side stalking four  it is a good movie if u havent read the book but if u reach the book you are screwedthere are so many to list but they are so obvious and stupid that the suspension of disbelief is totally gone nano bots so small they are in the air and rain yet to be infected these people must be touched? ridiculous everyone in the entire area would be breathing them nano bots repair tissue heal skin restore eyesight? okay that is futuristic and believable main facility loses power and they are no longer getting healed okay i suppose the nanobots need some form of power but the previously healed revert back the blind man goes blind again? ridiculous he was already healed why do the fallen wounded float up to standing like some silly paranormal phenomenon? stupid effects that are so out of place and ruin the moment over and over again this movie was a complete poosandwich and the fact they gross over $100m is tantamount to theftthere are people out there who can write a half decent script and dont get the opportunity to ever have it heard there are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen there are scifi movies that have an original story that dont have a budget to be released at their full potential support people with talent and original ideas do not see guardians of the galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things congratulations on nailing the cgi though guys that was great if i felt like staring at great cgi for two and a half hours though id play call of dutythen this will be an amazing show if on the other hand you set your own standards and can read beyond the 9th grade level well youll find the dialog premise and sensationalism just too void of all reality and sensibility the characters interaction with one another is very one dimensional and monotone its like theyre robots with the single emotion of despair the male characters conversational scenes all have that iloveyou innuendo much like smallville supernatural and most any show that has been produced by the cw or the people involved in these shows the only thing missing from the homosexual innuendo is the scenes followed up by glorified anal sex the dialog is just outrageously terrible as if everything in these characters lives is emotionally draining and just having a simple normal human conversation is beyond their coping abilities every conversation is a scene of coping its just so manipulative in an attempt to get the consumer deeply empathizing with the characters and creating a very unhealthy unnatural emotional attachment to fantasy rather then finding these needs within their real relationships every show on cw does this and i truly see the fate of our species being quite dire as the consequence sure its your fault for watching but just as much theirs for making it available the action varies from awesome to stupid we have the nonsensical flipping spinning acrobatic maneuvers that would get you killed along with a man with a bow and arrow out gunning 12 men with fully automatic weapons that never seem to run out of bullets how is that good entertainment? its just the same crap ive been seeing since i was 8 years old that became increasingly stupid to me starting at about the age of 15 it went from well i am watching for the outrageous unbelievable fantasy action film or show to why am i still watching this crap? its a lot of money to deliver us the same nonsense were used to theyre exploiting the immaturity of the current generation who has decided to let the world set their standards and assume that since everyone else is going along for the ride their standards must be high i just see no point in taking the action style of hercules legendary journeys and giving it a bigger budget and more takes so the editors can churn out something suitable for prime time face it youre a bunch of half wits with pathetically low standards if youre over the age of 16 and think this is an awesome show its a show for children teenage girls and middle aged women like most of cws programmingthe writing for this series is beyond simplistic and is heavy handed which coincidentally aligns perfectly with the amateurish direction and phenomenally bad acting david ramsey puts in the best performances which should speak volumes about the stink quality of the other actors the cgi quality is laughable video games have better effects for petes sake the editing of the fight sequences at times look as if a live actor is fighting a blue screen and the foes are edited in later and rather poorly at that then it looks as if frames are removed to make the action appear faster the result is the arrow is fighting a bit out of phase with the other combatants and the action looks choppy as well two episodes in and i cant imagine this hopeless dreck surviving a complete season even on a twobit channel like the cwthe visuals were wonderful and that is about all i can say that was good about this film either the men were without members or were brutish bastages that were the cause of all the problems it started out good but why is it that there has to be a different take on a film or story just to outright slander defile and degrade men? i tried to like it but i see this trend in a lot of movies today women can be pure evil in their own right without the help of a man i was really hoping that elle fanning would shine in this film but she was mind numbingly dull the three fairies were stupid the prince should not even have been in the film if he was not going to save her with a kiss the true loves kiss part was wickedly betrayed by what only another woman can give even if she is not the girls mother is this what you want your daughter to think about men in general?the universe is full of fascinating facts its mindbending to contemplate for example the awesome size of our galaxy light travels 186000 miles per second and yet it takes 100000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire milky way galaxy and our galaxy to quote carl sagan is only one among billions and billions the vastness of space truly is stunning but thanks to a worm hole the folks in interstellar leave the milky way in a cosmic snap of the fingers and yet having just achieved this most amazing of all feats our heroes are pretty much bored to tears instead everybody is more concerned with some fatherdaughter relationship that wasnt developed in the first place look if youre going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe then do it have some wonderment in the story dazzle me not only with visuals but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe and why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics or at least some theories thereof? this movie takes something that would dwarf the apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous plan aplan b tediousness i suggest instead watching through the wormhole with morgan freeman or re watching 2001 a space odyssey heck even contact with jodie foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than interstellar and yet  92 stars im not saying 10star reviews on this site are phony after all major film critics also are raving about interstellar unfortunately i find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie frankly interstellar is a boring movie and if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers fine i can live with that because i have minimum standards when i pay $11 for admission and $850 for large popcorn stay home and read a good book instead or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universethe trailers had me anticipating something like early james bond as a super hero this movie made the characters look like jokes the obviously sped up fight scenes looked stupid and omg samuel jackson looked ridiculous dressed like a skater punk besides the fact that it was totally outside the atmosphere that the movie was supposedly creating it is just sad for samuel jackson i get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days sean connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and jackson or his handlers should try that other than that what i can tell you about the movie without spoilers is limited  it is an action movie that i suppose is about as good as most in the genre but it could have been more it seemed to be an attempt to create a new mythical hero in the kingsman and i believe that was a failure it was unclear why these people existed as chaos and death seemed even more likely with them than without them kingsman is a poor myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification thats hollywood i guess but i hoped for morethe trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive reviews for the duration i couldnt shake the fact that everything i was seeing i had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer gotg lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s from which it took most of the scenes mid showing i walked out to make a phone call i almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story character wit or creativity that the first half utterly lacked fortunately i saw it alone so i didnt have to deal with the social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matine discountthe trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive

social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matin_e discountthe story was initially promising but after mission start of the film had unfortunately many lengths it would have been better to put this place 2h 3h the whole film has somehow worked very pieced together  the scifi ideas were sometimes quite ok but not consistent in star trek z b the makers have previously carefully considered to create a coherent picture to in this film here it creates the rocket spaceship with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole  the special effects were on the level of 90 years  since ive been hoping for much more i went because of the extremely good reviews on imdb in this film and am just disappointed the script is predictable and badly executed acting is lame the trailer is misleading the characters and the plot did not click with me at all the cgi effects are awful not believable there in logic in the movie it is more like zombie movie if you want to see something nice with a nice sense of humor and the actual interesting plot then please do not watch this you will definitely be wasting your time what you get here is that you know the end of the first 5 minutes i mean come on the fight will be accepted in high society and movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have the money or you are a smart man you will be welcomed throughout the world this is really poor movie avoid this crapthe reviews score here made me look forward to watching this movie but what a disappointment it was i am seriously wondering what is wrong with todays audience when a movie like this get such good reviews maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction maybe people label budget fantasy movies science fiction ? anyway lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie first the lead actor i dont know how he is perceived in the us but looking with an european view mcconaughey is just plain horrible at acting he has no facial expressions and talks english with a slow slur that is really annoying then later on in the movie i see a good actor like topper grace and wonder what the casting director thought when shehe hired mcconaughey there is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch again mcconaughey should be a car salesman not an actor then there is the pace of this slow moving epic we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3 i kid you not the way the lead manages to find the secret nasa base is laughable there is a base with literally hundreds of people working there in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks remember earth is dying so everyone has a v8 pickup to find indian drones then there is the so called science in the movie apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part well dear professor please join mcconaughey as a car salesman as you dont have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it i have a bad feeling about the future of our species the radiation the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up is just one silly example of course mcconaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole of course how could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real american ending to this disaster of a movie then there is the robot made for a budget movie looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil  as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind two obligatory lcd panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about that robot sets the level for the special effects they look cheap  badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time as if they had some plastic contraption with a gopro attached to it handled by a 12 year old going bzzzzzzz as he moves it about yes its that bad there are many bad movies around and this is just one of them but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews did the people here not see other movies ever ? did they miss alien gravity or even star wars not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not hoping hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at  yeah what is the target audience for this and mcconaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest chevy dealerthe reason im writing this review is because i was told it an amazing movie etc etc however i would advise you all to not waste your time mathew mcconeghey is an excellent actor no doubt but in this movie i find him mumbling and its hard to understand what hes saying the storyline is completely unbelievable it does not make sense in the least its a really big stretch of the imagination and lets not forget matt damons role im still trying to figure out why he would play such an insignificant and antagonistic role opposite mathew mcconeghey as far as the graphics go i watched it in imax and though the special effects are cool in imax its not worth the 2 hrs of your time basicallyyoull walk out of there googling almost every phrase you heard dont say no one warned you the problem with kingsman the secret service is that it cant decide whether its a spy movie or a movie about violent killers or a comedy it tries to do some of all three it partially succeeds as a spy movie owing a lot to old james bond films and did anyone catch the reference to get smart? and granted there are a few funny moments but the violence overwhelms everything else theres plenty of gratuitous killing and its not the least bit subtle if thats your cup of tea prepare to have a great time for me i think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor plotwise its completely predictable a few minutes into the movie we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end very mild spoiler alert the movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned thanks a lot guys id gladly return the favor if i knew you were watching one last point some user reviews have complained that the fword is used quite a bit it is but really is that the most offensive thing here? the entire premise of the dastardly project and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it is far worse not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and neednt be taken seriously but most of it is just grossly and needlessly excessivethe plot in the near future earth has been devastated by drought and famine causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate when humanity is facing extinction a mysterious rip in the spacetime continuum is discovered giving mankind the opportunity to widen its lifespan a group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life the crew of the endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown coop the pilot of the endurance must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race nasas version of sophies choice its a horrible movie and i am shocked anyone likes it firstly it doesnt get moving until nearly an hour into this crapola by then most us us have checked out and have no interest the plot is idiotic and not even marginally based in the realm of scientific possibility i genuinely hated this moviethe only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle bart two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectedthe only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle b_art two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectedthe only thing worth seeing in this movie is the cgi it is beautifully done although i found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling i would give it an 8 for the cgi but the movie well thats quite another story they havent respected the classic the original story if so maleficent would be evil the original is a story of good vs evil right vs might and a lesson that love conquers all but rather than that simple formula this is a story of a jiltedbetrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child to me that is not respecting the original story and it didnt bring us what we love about this story it isnt a different but classic fairy tale the formula for a classic fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil this one muddles all the way through i didnt see anything in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original only the names and the spindle it was just a dark and horrible story i wouldnt bring my kids to see it this isnt a lesson of goods triumph over evil this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks its fair or even worse cant be helped this antihero worship mentality is not what any child needs and is the ruin of our society lets root for the bad guy lets understand the bad guy the bad guy is the hero no one is truly bad everyone who does evil has a backstory that made them that way pity the refuse of society the things they do are either learned or they were born that way but either way they are justified or cant help it we should never blame or judge anyones behavior as truly bad because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided dont blame me others actions made me do it i am right in whatever i do when i feel i have been wronged two wrongs dont make it right it makes it fair everything is excusable so long as i can think of an excuse so first she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself it would seem she is always right regardless because right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day so long as she felt it was right at the time she was never wrong no matter what she was doing she was always right she was just a victim of some selfish man men are putzes and men are evil show me one decent male role model in this story her companion was a weak tool governed by her his apparent feminine side was his only saving grace the prince was just a pretty face shallow and likely governed by his hormones the king was a user a phony governed by his greed the message here is women dont need men men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions women should be strong and not be fooled by a mans affections when people do bad it must have been for a good reason and really isnt wrong of them bad behavior doesnt warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion any attempt at a classic good vs evil concept only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak to conclude this story somehow meant to convey that love conquers all is a sham this movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe this movie is unfit for children no beauty appears in this dark tale alas it must have been sleepingi am certain mr walt disney is rolling over in his grave again and again over stuff like this this totally destroyed the disney original it basically told every viewer flat out you were lied to the first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you they have been lying about maleficent for ages poor maleficent evil parents what other lies have your parents told you? santa? the easter bunny? how dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters they dont exist bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie mr disney would have never done that and certainly never would have approved fantasies hopes dreams imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all coststhe one is because the high score the movie is not that terrible and some entertainment value maybe a 410 is more appropriate i found ben affleck acting was quite bad i didnt care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator but not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway the plot is just to impossibleincredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid ultimately you dont really care about what is happening because the husband character is flat and ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him he seems to not give 2 s**** why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? i dont know and i dont carethe name of the movie couldnt be better mission impossible because it was impossible of watching this is a very boring action film i hoped something better because the 2 tv series the nineties one and the sixties one were two great tv series but this movie man it was boring as hell i dont know how i didnt fall sleep in the middle of the movie it could be more boring? tom cruise in one of his worst performances not only him everyone in the movie were so lame the plot itself have no sense so this is my review one of the most boring films i have seen in my life i give it 110the mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes but i gave it a second chance as the mystery developed the boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn but affleck and pike were so cold and mysterious even with each other that it was hard to like either of them so where was your emotional engagement here? only margo was remotely interesting this film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed this was a film of two parts the first part ran through all the clichs of the detective thriller but we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it in agatha christie books when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing as things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario then they get caught end of story in this particular tale it was the diary why would desi have taken it to a house he didnt know existed and fail to burn it properly when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? the cops would have seen through that in seconds and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled what about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? the purchase of the car the credit card purchases of the electronic toys the puppets the treasure hunt clues ? none of which could be attributed to desi so someone else must have organised or staged them and just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? all non  sequetors that made no sense in the end columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel but the cops just let her off  the non  examination by the medics of the blood covered pike was utterly ridiculous this hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply dont look for them dont let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if i get run over  she would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged we also got treated to homages to fatal attraction and the hand that rocked the cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane not just confident and calculating this is the old male gaze all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itthe

rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itthe movie would be descent if it wasnt 3 hours long found myself and my friend begging for the ending so we could walk out the theater as we were somewhere in the middle of the row i love the concept but i think its too linear  no major twists in the story that could come from nowhere everything is so predictable and could be packed in a maximum of 100 minutes also the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie too sad and without energy not moving enough i think that the soundtrack was there to kill any thrill you could enjoy watching this film the animations are 1010 but overall i was glad when i finally got out the theater so  110 is my final verdictthe movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo jumbo the special effects were a total let down saw it in imax not impressed the story had no speed very draggy performances were ok no oscars here the previews were the best part of the lure the middle was right out of 2001 space odyssey i have never been to a movie where so many people left about 2530 which was most of the crowd my daughter and i stuck it out hoping for some redemption but none came i should have seen it at a bargain matine very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look pleasethe movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo

none came i should have seen it at a bargain matin_e very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look pleasethe movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those huge mistake to say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie i have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better the story is dumb and entirely predictable the characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view acting was also poor visual effects were ok and being a 3d movie helped but that is the only positive thing that i can say about the movie the theater was halffull but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard the only way i can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed marvel fanboys and sockpuppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewersthe movie was horrible i saw it because i was chaperoning four thirteen year old girls who were dying to see it the whole theater was full of a similar group sex and age subpar acting very idiotic main story a complete waste of time and money there is really no much more to be said perhaps i am not in the demographic for the book and movie i am over forty years old but i could not wait for it to finish to go home and spit the mouthful of puke i was holding please take my advise and spare yourself the suffering of this i sacrificed myself for you and i have come to advise you from your future not to fall as i didthe movie versions of mission impossible are complete crap that are nothing like the tv series the movie versions of mission impossible turned the tv shows hero jim phelps into a bad guy and made a character ethan hunt who wasnt even in the tv series into the hero of the movies it would be like making a movie adaptation of the ateam with colonel hannibal smith turning into a bad guy killing the rest of the team and then having a totally new character not in the tv series be the hero of the movie moreover the movie versions of mission impossible are just another action movie with fancy stunts and bigbudget explosions like the james bond movies the tv series wasnt about stunts and explosions the tv series was about cleverlydevised cloakanddagger plots to trick the bad guys into turning against each other the tv series was about outsmarting the bad guys with brains not beating the bad guys with brawn in fact there were probably less punches thrown during the entire two tv series than during the mission impossible movie the producers of the mission impossible movie just wanted a way to market tom cruise in an action movie with fancy gadgets and bigbudget explosions but there are so many of these similar movies that have already been made so they called it mission impossible to lure in fans of the old tv series if youre just looking for a bigbudget remake of a rambotype movie then go ahead and see this movie but if youre a fan of the mission impossible tv series then dont waste your time on this crap of a moviethe movie starts lengthy with building the plot base everyone knows from the trailer or movie description after five minutes i already feel out of breath but try hard to sit through the boring conversations and the obvious i need lots of chips and popcorn to endure this phase after the long wait in the middle of the movie i am rewarded with excellent cgi effects and technological advances that would make everybody saliva and handle over their money immediately in real life its easy to fall in love with this digital creature who comes up with such great ideas i was thinking open api would be l33t if will casters mission was to transcend i was waiting for him to commit to github i was waiting for great things in this movie but the movie clearly was not made for the educated masses but for a stubborn religious audience who likes all movies to be the same the plot turned sour but not unexpectedly the religious fanatics who want to play god and control everything on this planet team up to destroy the new intelligence with mortars they repeatedly attack the data center trying to destroy the new hope for the planet of course the few religious lunatics win by the most crazy means ever with a virus its beyond me how a supercluster ai intelligence does not have security all emotional attachment aside there should be security running as basic protocols in the background after all he was connected to the internet a dangerous place was the data center running on windows xp first edition ?? in the beginning of the movie the first thing will caster did after going digital was to rewrite his code base this is what everybody would have done  optimize code all the time after all its his natural state to be digital and to innovate therefore the virus was impossible to implement the code to compromise by max waters did not even exist anymore  we learned that after 20 minutes in how would will  as an intelligent being  not create his own programming language and complete code rewrite? how??? all in all a very disappointing piece of cgi bliss it makes me upset about the religious screenwriter who once again gives us the american nightmare its possible to kill all innovation with weapons and religious people will always rule and controlthe movie is not worth keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the sleeping beauty disney is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations i was very looking forward to see the movie since disney has a good record on movies although some of the last one has not been very good including this one but for example if you saw frozen you though disney is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed thru time this movie maleficent is not one of them you wont be attract to even repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story maybe if disney management could use the imagination so much they promote to young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever heard before and could sell it but for what reason will disney corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time years after years mom to girl princess to princess beautiful story where the prince rescue the princess the king father and queen mother love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy by the goodness and them the prince and princes leave happily ever after if only mr walt disney were alive to see of what his disney world has becomethe movie chronicles the journey of a group of astronauts traveling through space in search of a new planet on which to establish a new colony of humans due to the physics involved they remain young whilst their family back on earth grow old their entire journey lasts for about 60 years considering the high ratings i really expected this to be an epic movie in reality nothing happens it literally felt as though i was trapped in their tiny little space ship for 60 years the plot is based on complex theoretical concepts but in the end makes no sense whatsoever there is no action no romance no comedy no special effects and very little meaningful dialogue if anything the movie has more of a documentary feel to it the visuals were nothing special and the music reminded me of a superman movie from the early 80s i just didnt get itthe most retarded film ive seen so far with depp triumph of stupidity discreditation of science fruits of which we are using to better our lives each day a point that there is no life beyond human body is even more dumb a wife that should be in best traditions the first traitor of a man and a friend that is eager to kill you based on only his own assumptions also shocked the idea that a common way to act for people is to kill stuff first then think if i had options id love to send the script author to mars so he wont be able to share his idiotic primitive ideas never ever again after watching this movie i felt the upcoming depression from understanding that it was most likely targeted on the farmers popultaion of low educated people somewhere in albania that are living in darkness fear aggression and no hope not adviced to watched for people with iq > 90the most disappointing movie of 2015 so far i was looking forward to it since the divergent was pretty consistent with just a few awkward spots however insurgent i would call it complete trash with just one goal  earn money the visual effects were good except for those long shots being made just for the 3d  like the flying above the city in the end it looked so cheap the plot is predictable very slowboring most of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results the movie completely lacks logical structure  not sure if its written like this in the book too spoler alert how everyone is so ok not to guard a guy who had been an enemy just few moments ago? how would whole army get to the building without being noticed?the marvel team has once again given us another bunch of junk the ever growing marvel cinematic universe deserves to be destroyed and i found myself rooting for the bad guys to put the rest of the sappy characters out of their misery james gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown guardians of the galaxy much to his detriment unlike iron man captain america and thor join this film as partners in grime an unmitigated disaster total junk a complete waste of time and utterly forgettable stay home and watch friends reruns they are more creative and still more relevant than this unimaginative unoriginal mishmash of plagiarized elements from other films ugghhhhthe main actor is as wooden as they come and looks ridiculous in every scene after the opening few seconds i knew it was going to be awful i saw a bad explosion effect and a man wearing a silly looking hood and an obviously fake beard in fact everyone looks ridiculous with bad make up and lighting the writing is painfully dull any attempts at humor are mind bogglingly unfunny the main character is highly unlikable and it is difficult to find anything with which to identify the director seems to have done nothing but point the camera in the right direction as there is no flair or artistry evident how does this have a high review i just cant understand itthe life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 where the actors ellar coltrane patricia arquette ethan hawke played the film in real time so it took 13 years to make one of the few films i have ever walked out on the others were in disgust but this one i left due to pure boredom one hour into the film and there had been only 5 minutes of drama then the film was back to documenting the boring fictional life of a boring fictional family now the whole idea of actors who age naturally with the film could have been interesting but the director completely pooched this fantastic opportunity by slavishly doing the film chronologically and slooooooowly instead of mixing it up a bit and showing us the boys life at 6 then at 18 then back to 15 but instead year trailed after year and after an hour i really felt like i had lived through those first few years in real time too so here is my list of things that are more fun that watching boyhood  cleaning your gutters did that earlier today and found a frog that was more exciting  waiting in the waiting room of the dentist at least there is some suspense  getting your teeth drilled by the dentist at least you feel something  a good bowel movement the smell only lasts a few minutes not three hours i could obviously continue but you get the drift this film is the ultimate triumph of style over substance nice idea technically totally forgettable as a filmthe irony about transcendence is that its all about artificial intelligence but it lacks even the most natural of intelligence completely though it starts with a big promise of strong things to come it falls weak and on its knees so fast that once its done you realize that depp has taken you on a joy ride i cannot exactly say if its an entire waste of 120 minutes of your life but it sure does not add any more value to it transcendence looks like the big budget disaster of 2014 so far which the crown held by after earth last year for some its would be ok to argue that the movie was too complicated and its only for the thinkers but in my point of view thinking too much about this would only makes you feel sorry for doing it when will caster johnny depp who is a renowned scientist in artificial intelligence dies his wife uploads his consciousness to a program expecting that his great knowledge can be harvested for future as expected wills consciousness perform brilliantly but evolves in to a greater power and a threat than being an asset and when he breaks the barriers of nano technology he starts to play god the plot clearly has lot of potential but its not something groundbreaking or never heard of before therefore transcendence is already decades late but tries hard to be futuristic but still it could have being save it if didnt have some obvious mistakes there are so many plot holes that make it completely unjustifiable and qualify to be an effective science fiction or a drama if wish to continue to the end you have to completely withdraw yourself from them and go along but its something not very easy to do i dont want to give out any spoilers but keeping the ai part and the nano part aside as they are fictional the stuff that actually happens right now are depicted in a complete bogus manner here how the story flows and the events taken place is far from its narrative and you cant really forgive it seems like the cast is a way to salvage it but to be honest nor depp or morgan has a strong part to perform so their appearance is a waste the fans of both will only end up disappointed and there are some poor looking action scenes that pop up time to time and even that make little sense the cg is not brilliant and cinematography is mundane but the hope of the big cast and the plot i somehow went through the whole moviethe idea of the film is great they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored however i feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together forgive me if ive missed anything but i feel that i spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude illmannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life i spent the entire film looking for the beauty or the message in this masterpiece and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up nothing bloody happened my definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration something which makes you think about an interesting topic i was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake hollywood crap also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending or some sort of redeeming quality like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasnt genuinely being considered great imdb rating 90? maybe thats a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in hollywood is laughing at us unfortunately the minimum rating is 110 whereas i believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate in ancient rome they had no concept of negative numbers i feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0 dont see this film please and for goodness sake dont let it win any oscars i dont want the industry to be polluted with films like thisthe good reviews of interstellar on imdb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies the current imdb rating is 91no way in hell is that an accurate rating this movie is awfulperiod how could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie? i really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it the actor list reads like a whos who of movie stars but i cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it trust me dont waste 3hours of your life on this film you will regret it just like i dothe good reviews made me watch the movie full out and this was one of the worst hours spent in my life i really have no clue how people can enjoy this movie only if it resonates with an interest for the mundane mediocre average life the movie has not one interesting plot twist the main character is an uninspiring slow paced cynical person his sister is also not a very interesting person to watch the dialogs are just average everyday conversations if this movie gets an oscar i seriously have my doubts about the voting system life can be an uplifting experience the whole movie seems to portray that life is a long string of events to which you have very little influence and the only thing you have left to do is wait and sit out life to me it is incomprehensible to take 12 years and come up with this very disappointing view on life and play it out so boringly there is one scene that actually touched me a plumber reflects back on a lifes lesson he got from one of the main characters and how this positively shaped his life simply said it is a waste to watch this moviethe good cinematography and acting this is a beautiful film and the starstudded cast did as well as could be expected under the circumstances the bad the script this film should be an edgeoftheseat thriller and an exploration of what is possible in the future instead it was as flat as a busted balloon there was no tension there was stuff exploding but we didnt care aside from the lack of suspense a contributing factor to the flaccid plot was the premise scifi films require a simple explanation for the breakthrough being depicted in back to the future we are taken all over the spacetime continuum we get the rules and we go along for the ride the concept of cyberhuman evolution is ahead of the story we do not get the parameters of the concept are these new beings cyberpeople? what are those flying dots? are they pieces of people or matter? there isnt a cohesive story about the scientific breakthrough we do not know when the characters are in jeopardy or what will happen when the thing gets them we dont know what the thing is even death does not have absolute boundaries in this film but there is no explanation for how johnny depp finds a way back at some point we give up trying to put together an explanation for the author and we dont believe it there ends the magic of film we cannot suspend disbelief any longerthe first two acts carried the movie brilliantly ive never laughed harder at more one word dialog lines the action was incredible and the actingsublime some of britains best leading men are on display and their charm and wit are matched only by the twinkling glee that all this is delivered with tonguefirmlyincheek and then they threw it all away in the third act what a disaster witty banter replaced with cannedcatchphrases charm replaced with scatological nonsense incredible stunts replaced with the same tired line work that grew old during the third matrix movie many movies disappoint because they never rise this movie disappoints by how close it came to being truly incredible want to know when to leave? leave when colin firth is out of the picture up to that point its a fun ride but frankly the whole picture hits an iceberg and sinks deep into the abyss after that smug cocky and secondrate the picture becomes a model of the protagonist before making his journey one is left hoping that the entire affair does not spawn a sequelthe first thing you notice is that females are universally portrayed as the source of good and happy and light and the more effeminate the character the better masculine qualities are invariably associated with greed anger pettiness and violence and the more masculine the character the more corrupt reminded me of elfquest there is a tendency in modern entertainment such as broadways wicked to portray evil by men as internally motivated and evil by women as externally provoked its not her fault she did x it was the only option available to her because of what he did its not that she was powerhungry and caused pain to retain her power shes just misunderstood and once we embrace the feminine superiority the world will be a better place retelling the story would be pointless so i wont include any spoilers what matters is the overarching theme this message is wrapped up in a cacophony of sparkle & wideangle camera work but its still a feminist fantasy in which girls are smarter & stronger than boys the feminine is divine and the masculine must be destroyedthe first five minutes of guardians of the galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun creative and quirky ride then after 1015 minutes went by i couldnt help but feel ive seen this exact movie before i had it was a film entitled raiders of the lost ark you may of heard of it if you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film so they updated it with a lot of cgi and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now of course pepper in a cameo with stan lee right? the movie gets worst from there on out the cgi is over the top the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them one minute they are trying to kill each other or not kill each other for some reason why put him in a bag? i dont get it just take the orb then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 2030 minute cgi jack fest that looks just like another film this time they decided to duplicate star wars episode ii not a good film to replicate a space chase with cgi only lucas could love ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film you might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well this leaves us a little later on with peter quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him sure cue more cgi and miraculous healing a minute later to his face after all he isnt mortal is he? or is he? there is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him they have a prison suit that fits a 2 tall raccoon who doesnt know what a raccoon is even though he speaks english but not a prison suit that fits a 8 tree i think this was a case of the cgi department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent the tree has a case of the hodors but not unlike chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences except with chewbacca we could infer solo was guesstimating what chewy was saying and having fun with it this is not the case the raccoon actually understands everything the film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it we took their cue ten minutes later the person i was with kept looking at me like really?? and left as well the film was an obnoxious capitalistic cgi jack fest that had no story that wasnt stolen from three other high grossing films no character development and no creativity to give you an example of how uncreative it is after ripping off the entire intro to raiders of the lost ark the director i assume tried to pull a song from the reservoir dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film in this case hooked on a feeling was used when? when the characters were entering prison of course why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison contrast this with the brilliant work of tarantinos use of the same song in reservoir dogs its like the director never saw reservoir dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film what happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? it just disappeared midway thru the film and didnt return til later they had to have the episode ii cgi jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene i could go on from there about how bad this movie was but i would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition dvd at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions i might just do that until then ill cross my fingers and hope jj can save the holy trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye its no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for episode ivthe first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich_ even if in an unusual packaging lets compare it to transcendence despite its few flaws transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end it was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout not so this one it was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid the scary thing is that this salivating blockbuster is cheered with a 9 rating while transcendence is written off as something unrealthe first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich even if in an unusual

killed a lot of people wins against a peaceful superb being that tries to heal the world and they dont just destroy it they try to deceive it using the wife who in 1 second decided to betray her husband the deception fails and the final terrorist girl just waves her gun into the air points to another friend who has betrayed will and just commands kill your fng self and your wife too just so i wont shoot your friend why will doesnt save his wife while simulating death? even better why cant will neutralize one small stupid terrorist girl? how is it he able to get over every other military unit but not this one? cant he use one of his minions to jump fast and furious? cant he attack her from behind? cant he after all just heal his friend? so one stupid terrorist girl makes the world healing machine commit suicide and basically murder his own wife for whom he was doing this all and who betrayed him in no time and without any doubts terrorists win planet loses basically this film is about that if you believe in something so hard that you will kill many people for it and just demand your enemies to kill themselves youll get what you want its about go terrorists go if you think that you are doing good thing its all good the worst possible ending everthe film seemed amazing up until the last 20 minutes of it where logic just blew away and the worst possible ending appeared

you want its about go terrorists go if you think that you are doing good thing its all good the worst possible ending everthe dustbowli didnt understand the usage of old interview footage from survivors of the early dustbowls made no sense corn is the only viable crop? okay i didnt get the whole antiscience apollo faked landings schtick it was irrelevant to the plot in fact the plot points out that science is mans only hope here why indeed have our future selves placed a wormhole next to saturn and not the moon where its more convenient? why cant our future selves if they are so advanced simply contact us directly or show up? why cant they appear in the past when it wasnt too late to save the planet? what was the deal with the barely habitable planets of ice and water and rocks? earth is a jewel yet these places wouldnt support any human populations and indeed they even pale to the dustbowl earth depicted in the movie how is it that weve got advanced enough technologies for ai robots and blackhole venturing spacecraft but we cant save the earth? enters a black hole enters a tesseract of space time and the best he can do is ping a watchs second hand? back to my comment about our future selves right theres only one thing thats rewarding in this movie and its the rather recycled but still fun to watch aspects of the various launches and spacecraft operation yay unfortunately this is a grand total of about 5 minutes of footage the sound in this movie is impressive but at several points it overwhelms the lame dialoguethe creators of this movie had an agenda a were afraid of technology so lets kill it no matter the cost agenda so lets make a movie about it oh and lets spend a lot of money and hire a lot of known faces to spread this agenda and the loopholes in the script wow those loopholes did jdepp and mfreeman even read the script before starting production?? seeing this movie only causes people to resent building an ai to resent progress to resent what the human species has been doing for the past 200k yeasts or so evolving there is nothing wrong in the actions of the ai in this movie only those of the humans trying to stop it eventually causing the humanitys own demisethe buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written the character is not believable in the least a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts a foreign language and acrobatics? come on not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker you call that believable? really? besides he wants to be a good guy and save the city so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people whos only visible crime is working for a mobster some good values there no doubt the other characters are not much better each of them is a stereotype of some kind not a rounded complicated human being in almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst tv shows ive ever seen i will not watch the second episode honestly i wish i could unwatch the first onethe beginning of the movie was okay and the back story was understandable however trying to make the villain of a classic disney movie into a good guy is infuriating i understand how the directors wanted to make a change but why? there is no point in making a huge change in a classic disney movie for example prince phillip was not at the ceremony as a boy defeating the whole purpose of the main highlight song i know you once upon a dream which did not happen in the movie they met of him asking for directions another thing the fairies flaura fauna and maryweather in the original movie were at least somewhat responsible but in this movie they were the most stupid dimsighted caretakers ive ever seen in the movie they didnt even cast the names not to mention the hilarious cakedress scene they made for auroras 16th birthday aurora never dances with philip which again defeats the whole purpose of the true loves kiss speaking of which the whole true loves kiss scene never happens which makes me want to rip hair out of my head its the whole point of sleeping beauty the whole castle never falls asleep and maleficent awakes aurora with a true loves kiss what? maleficent never turns into a dragon which was the best part of the original movie where the prince slays the evil fairy and saves the princess thats what we want to see basically the only good thing about the movie were the special effects and cgi other than that the whole movie was disappointingthat summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage fiction which is so poor it deserves to be labelled as tripe in and of itself the divergent series is based on books of the same name which means right from the off many of us who havent read said books knew there would be a devoted fanbase to the series i dont begrudge those fans their opinions and i cant speak for how this movie works as an adaptation what i can do is summarise its effectiveness appeal and overall enjoyability as a standalone piece of cinematography and on the whole i am thoroughly amused in a pitying way the characters have zero appeal because weve seen them all before the deer in the headlights type of teenage lead the heartless and shallow arch enemy and an ensemble of clichs including but not limited to the male warrior and sex appeal the small group of enlightened protagonists the gormless population living under heel etcetera etcetera i had an issue with the distinct lack of originality in the first movie with it bearing notable similarities to huxleys brave new world and orwells 1984 not to mention the more recent hunger games and other pieces of dystopian fiction the point is the movie stands on the work of other successful franchises  whether novels or movies  and allows those series to lay the groundwork for what it portrays as a riproaring fight against tyranny but which is in reality another slugfest of brainless acting numbing action and unoriginal plot points im not going to say anything overly negative against shailene woodley as ive yet to see her in anything but this series but im unimpressed with her acting potential thus far she isnt helped by the poor script and mediocre directing so i wont be too critical but by this stage im not holding my hopes up for an upandcomer in anything beyond typecast roles in future productions the acting of the support cast is what you might expect  an attempt to appeal to the youthful masses and bearing no distinctly original traits of their own in any sense whatsoever the worst part has to be the story the simple motive is if youve seen it in dystopian features youll probably see it in the divergent series the basic structure is flimsy with regards to the castes huxley fans will see what i did there that people are forced to choose and the idea of a rebellion against the oligarchy portrayed is so clichd that it just doesnt hold any interest in fact you might be able to accurately predict the majority of events which transpire in this film and as any moviegoer will tell you that is never a good thing we need originality and we arent given it by any stretch of the imagination action flicks for teenagers need a new format if theyre going to survive i feel and this does nothing to refresh the genre on the contrary its rather like dragging a dead horse into the town square and then repeatedly whipping it for laughs although the only laughs are mine and theyre painful if youre a fan of the novels or someone seeking pointless cinematic thrills you might enjoy this but if you have a refined taste in films or are expecting to see something worth the popcorn i advise you to flee not walk away but literally flee with cheetahlike pace and dont look backthat summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage

backtell mewhat do you get when you take a bunch of computer nerds who have no concept of effective storytelling and put them into a room to make a movie? you get transcendence the whole thing is based on special effects its a film by people who think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is artor something i am so tired of movies where all that matters is how cool it looks the plot was ridiculousat the end of the movie a group of twentysomething guys were exiting ahead of us and one of the guys said that was pretty excellent i thought well i guess its working for its demographic so to everyone involvedgive up your gun toting worldisan illusion horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good uselike film schooltake the nonsense of inception multiply by about 1000 add some soap opera moments and you get interstellar i dont have to check the spoiler box because there is nothing to spoil or rather there is everythingto spoil but there isnt time enough to call out the instances of bad dialog poor acting lousy hair jobs words strung together that sound interesting but mean nothing contradictions galore real black holes aka plot holes one liners designed to emotionally hook the audience cause there aint no substance visuals to distract cause there aint no substance deus ex machinas as needed and they are too frequently needed etc and so on oh did i mention bad evil mixing? and for those of you whiners about hate no this isnt about hate its about the lack of sound movie making the only sound movie making principle followed isyou get a hap hap happy hollywood ending in sum a shakespearean epitaph is appropriate full of sound and fury signifying nothing ps i did enjoy the music but my bad couldve gotten that for a lot less investment of time and moneysweet suffering christ  this was an absolute howler  god only knows why mm got involved as i thought he was on the up  ok its supposed to be scifi and im all for a wee trip through a wormhole with a return leg through a black hole only to be picked up by the local taxi that was orbiting saturn  this garbage should have been left in a toilet hole  north korea has more street cred than this  ive had more fun scraping dogturd from the deep grooves of my walking boots  i cant believe that a movie that got you to sign up for almost 3 hours could be so consistently pathetic with no redeeming story lines  this stunk more than an overflowing greek beach toilet at the height of summerspoilers i sacrificed myself by entering a black hole in my spacesuit endured a lsd trip of love to send you this singular message not for me but for the good of mankind this is a movie which literally gets worse by the minute should your cinema be graceful and insert a break use it get out the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years youll probably realized the heartwarming end to it already anyway apparently mankind was able to master robotics and an ai worthy of star trek but still uses current spaceships except when they dont somewhat later cause you know it just wouldnt have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets also it wouldnt have been impossible to send probes to the planets because  well that wasnt in the script either it was however possible to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon that one hour stretches to seven years might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization apart from all that nonsense reality like being sucked into it or getting grilled by gamma rays so i have wasted several hours and even some minutes more to write this but if it saves one soul from enduring this spoilers are added in my short review  well  its hard to describe what i watched about an hour ago  ive read the books  of course they are not something special or brilliant but they can perfectly take place in the list of enjoyable ones  i was shocked how much the director has changed the plot of the books and the way that the main characters should be presented in this movie  one word dissapointment   somehow i lost the connection with the whole atmosphere in the middle of the movie  it felt like it is a different story that was missing something  dont know why but the performance of shailene didnt work for me this time  her pretty face just ruined everything that i imagined as a strong and tough character in insurgent   a lot of the key moments in the book were gone and for the readers especially it was not that much of a satisfaction   the second part of the movie was a total disaster  i cant believe how the writer agreed for such a dramatic change in the plot  while sitting and watching the movie i was so inpatient to see the final battle  the emotional conclusion  the way jeanine should have died but the thrill suddenly disappeared after a few scenes   what was that with the box ? some kind of joke or what ? i cant imagine what is gonna be the next movie allegiant and im not sure if im gonna watch it but probably it will be something far away from the real story  the only pros of insurgent were the great cinematography and visual effects supported with not that bad soundtrack   spoiler? just describing the first scene i sit down with my ten year old expecting to be entertained heard so much about this movie its this generations star wars right? first scene a tragic heartjerker that kills off the kids mother what the  who asked for this? i hold my kids hand and we plunge on then a bunch of running around and dumb violence about the time somebody for some reason who claims his father had been killed and his grandfather takes a big hammer and smashes someones head so blood can trickle down into this reservoir my kid and i looked at each other and said are you enjoying this at all? of course not so we left maybe it gets fun and charming after half an hour but honestly this is todays entertainment???spoiler alert i cant believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie on the plus side brilliant cg fx cinematography on the negative side the awful acting the terrible plot the script the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience i really liked mcconaughey in dallas buyers club  by far the best thing hes done to date but in this movie? just another flybythe seatofthepants astronaut risking everything and everyone but it all works out in the end of course way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending which came as no surprise whatsoever thanks to the ghost and then we discover that love conquers all including science of course probably most of the reason i rated this so low is because with a name like interstellar i was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel the time relativity concept et al sigh and the smartass wisecracking robot was the last straw just so badspoiler alert and warning they were lobbing fbombs at you on par with the quantity in the die hard movies they used the bait and switch method of advertising in their trailer the trailer would have you believe colin firth saved a kid from the streets as in obi wan and luke skywalker agent kay and agent jay enders game etc you see that trailer and that is what you are expecting then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? crude for the sake of it the man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie i thought surely it cant be that much longer he couldnt wait to go to the rest room he never came back i guess hed been warned about the last scene being so vulgar i wish id read the reviews before i went so i would have left when he did or not gone at all im so tired of cgi newsflash movie makers real people cant fly sideways for 20 feet i will be finding out who made this movie and i will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life so ill know of any vulgarities so i can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warningsometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is saying a lot since i have been an avid film watcher for 60 years i am used to comic based films as being somewhat thin on the depth of plot lack of character development i suppose one is expected to be a comic reader to fill in the gapsi am not and filled with a plenitude of special effects to wow the audience taking their attention away from the actual film not being that good that said at least a newbie to the story line of the comic book being portrayed can get some minimal entertainment from the film genre this film did not even provide that i was embarrassed for the actors who apparently knew only two degrees of acting recite the lines with no emotional involvement or overact every single line from the simplest to the more emotionally complex of which there were few it was painful for me to see the art so debased the dialog itself was sophomoric and clichd requiring only a third grade education to comprehend the film editing subtracted more than it added to the film while there was much action in the film the editing jumped too quickly between different shots of the action to get anything more than a vague sense that something was happening with no real sense of the specifics of the action all in all at $170000000 marvel could and should have done something to engage more than a superficial response in their audience  which began and ended with opening their wallets to pay to see this $170000000 travesty i gave it 2 stars only because of the films budget and took away 8 because it proves that spending that kind of money still cannot create a film with any redeeming social or intellectual value whatsoeversometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is saying a lot since i have been an

intellectual value whatsoeversomeone who claims to have enjoyed this mess might like to attempt a brief summary of the plot not omitting as the film did why these boring people were doing what they were possibly the only really effective scene is simply lifted from jules dassins `topkapi but the actor holding the rope in this version is nowhere near as interesting as peter ustinov in the original perhaps the silliest effect in motion picture history  the entire traininthechunnel sequence is completely incredible  occurs where the cruse character throws himself back on the tgv using the explosion of the helicopter see fellows the human cannonball at the circus is faked human bodies are destroyed not harmlessly transported by explosions mmle beart however is worth rememberingso the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years wow yeah crazy you know what else happened over a period of 12 years? lots of nothing to lots of other people just like in this movie in which nothing freaking happens 12 years and this is what they came up with? for crying out loud this movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an arkansas corn field for 12 years maybe my lifes so much more interesting than everyone elses who gave this movie rave reviews are people so boring that its now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? and the guy is gay didnt anyone else notice that? ive nothing against gay people but were supposed to believe hes straight come on if thatd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there look hes finally coming out of the closet shocker and what did these people have against hair brushes? maybe its too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening a hint of not so awfullyboringwhygoddidiagreetowatchthis? i want a refundso the big movie of the yearthe big thinker even came up on 9gag asking is this possible i got excited oh boywas i wrong the movie is just terrible they are just throwing that space terminology around like potatoes and people think yea this is smart movie very insightful and out of the box thinking and smart and stephen hawking theorylike way of describing something the people that sayit is great and i got the movie are just arrogant 323i4h5 trying to look intelligent a lot of corners left for questioning and i hate the movie where i watch and ask out loud why the duck did you do that or why the duck didnt you say that when it is obvious it needs more explaining it all is based on us accepting some facts that they say in the movie only because they use few scientific concepts like neutron stars spinning black holes and time dilation but the rest is just pure guessing and in a bad way looks like nolan wanted to try and give it a shot and in 100 years if he got it right people will sayyea there was some guy nolan the producer and he was talking about this in the 2015but i doubt it i gave review for only two movies on imdb this one and batman dark knight risesboth same crap or maybe i am just oblivious and dumb for all of the people giving 88 on imdbso disney ambushes gregory maguire the author of wicked in this tepid retelling of sleeping beauty and the unnecessary explanation for the actions of the exquisite villain we love to hate maleficent maguire had a brilliant idea once upon a time his speculation about a wicked womans progression towards very bad behavior and the reasons behind that transformation changed fairy tales forever maguire caught lightening in a bottle using complex characters and situations to explain a life that ended with a bucket of water wicked had everything that maleficent does not compelling characters and a sturdy plot which gave the characters room to move and grow maleficent is the dollar general version of wicked for its tedious running time of 90some minutes it plods along throwing 200 million dollars of cgi imagery at you which is evidently supposed to divert you from noticing the plot holes and jawdroppingly abysmal dialog it feels padded out in many places its stingy in the extreme and comes across like a puppy thats peed on the carpet you cant hate a puppy all cuteness and earnest contrition for the wet spot maleficent wants your love so badly its willing to humiliate the best villain disney ever had we love maleficent simply because shes bad to the bone why should we care what happened to her back in the day? great villains are often just what they appear to be corrupt individuals who take pleasure in the suffering of others the original maleficent owned her darkness and in the end died for it this new terrible explanation for old mals bitchery was given to us by the horrid linda woolvertons screenplay woolverton also scribbled the wretched screenplay for tim burtons alice in wonderland this reimagining of why the old girl was such a meanie nearly turns disneys grande dame of evil into june cleaver all that was missing was a string of everyday pearls and a frilly apron lets not talk about the three fairies or the weak retelling of the famous pinkblue fight between them i wanted to spray them with raid and watch them die now thats evil evidently the backbone disney showed in 1959 allowing maleficent to invoke all the powers of hell in her dragon transformation is all gone being a real meanie is bad these days no one is accountable for doing bad things theyre just misunderstood being a meanie doesnt sell merchandise being a meanie and dying when you finally get caught doesnt allow for a sequel get ready for maleficent 2 forest frolics two stars one for each of angelina jolies cheekbone prosthetics a truly depressing film from a once innovative studioso  i was yesterday to see this big movie which has a rating of 87 close to the lord of the rings movies the same as matrix or inception and even better than seven or usual suspects it should be good right? doesnt matter that marvel made only crap movies most of them anyway with a few exceptions some of the first spiderman movies and some xmen movies maybe they nailed it this time so the movie starts and after the first scenes we see our hero on an abandoned planet dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for he is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset someone may be nearby anyway he got what he came for and the scene is very similar to the one in indiana jones no surprise this entire movie is a rip off of other movies you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys star wars you have a pair a raccoon and a tree only the raccoon understands the tree star wars again our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the femaleagain star wars only in star wars the process was more real and more fun also like other marvel movies the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship while peter quill and the others were waiting for gomora to cut the damn power another stupid moment was when ronan at last he lands but he doesnt destroy the planet the thing he wanted the most to do no he looks at our hero dancing speechless and how did drax survived when he and ronan are hit by a ship at full speed piloted by raccoon? so guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects explosions after explosions characters that are poorly written actors that dont act very well a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies conclusion another boring movie by marvel highly over rated i dont know how i think marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day you wanna see a good scifi movie watch any of the star wars moviesshould not be called a disney film  the original was fine angelina jolie was better in changeling a much more believable and oscarworthy role several of the actors did a bad job the guy playing the king was especially horrible elle fanning was annoying with her widerimmed smile they turned the three fairies everyone loved into completely hideous idiots bordering on child abuse almost all the characters were onedimensional and uninteresting and how was it that aurora didnt cry when her father died? why didnt anyone see the one of the magical trees at the beginning of the film totally resemble the balrog from fellowship of the ring??? ugh i wish this film could be erased from existence 210  a 2 for the nice effects but the story is overall badly flawed and tries with unsuccessful efforts to shatter categoriesseriously? some people are rating this 10? im no physicist but i do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility firstly the first line of the synopsis of this film on imdb scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? what? sorrybut no on our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world even north korea theyre being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature also we can grow vegetation without sunlight there are many people doing this today so why if for any reason would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? this is just the first problem i have with this film at no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was i want to know and i waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came secondly forgoing the wormhole if gravity is that strong to slow down time youd be crushed and waves wouldnt even exist let alone 100 foot waves thirdly the robot why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? throughout the film the same joke humour level at 75%? sarcasm rating at 80%? oh yes these jokes came thick and fast the only joke i could see is that this film was actually made and i wasted 3 hours of my life if you want to watch a brilliant sci fi with matthew maconaghy watch contact it was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist carl sagan now thats worthy of a 10 the only good point about interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack if you want that then go to a light show or concert sad to say im greatly disappointed nolan should stick with bat manseldom has there been a film where the critics opinions and its true quality diverge so seriously boyhood is empty because it lacks content and form it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary as a result it embraces nothingness and is in that sense deeply nihilistic and even depressing anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or more likely a better one those who praise the film always point out the same circumstance the only thing they can say which is this film is like real life i have to say this is true on the most superficial level imaginable but i may ask is that a good thing? is this if film history has taught us anything what a film should be? real life according to linklater means a lifespan during which nothing happens the boyhoodexperience is the equivalent of your experience waiting in line at the supermarket yes this is the real life linklater presents us nothing happens in this movie nothing no story no interesting characters just ordinary situations from real life of course there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great tarkovskys mirror antonionis lavventura or tarrs the turin horse come to my mind but you need ideas you got that linklater? you need a style or form which cannot be separated from the content you need a capable director that can create a form of visual communication boyhood offers none of those things the film gets praised especially by those who have never seen an arthouse movie and mistake it for an art film people are misled so easily boyhood is pure blankness shallowness superficiality nothingness to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value boyhood is in fact an antifilm in the sense that it stands against everything film should be  be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining fun movie the film is neither a work of art nor entertaining in that regard it can be called a nonfilm it celebrates its own nonexistence and drowns in its nihilism i doubt this was linklaters intention but it certainly is the result of what he created be warned this is not a drama the movie is the opposite of a carefully constructed work of art its nothing but a reenactment of memories a collection of unmeaning scenes we may or may not know from our own lives bowling playing video games reading harry potter etc i think it is only fair to ask what is the point? i went to see this film having high hopes and having read all the raving reviews expecting a masterpiece from richard linklater the director of the great waking life i liked the trailer which makes the movie look much more interesting than it actually is actually everything that happens in the movie is already in the trailer the basic idea of filming a boy growing into a young man during twelve years is interesting yes but sadly the film offers nothing more than that this is not enough sadly many critics seem to have liked the basic idea so much that to them it didnt even matter if the director would be able to make it interesting or not the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep he has no ambitions at some point he gets his first kiss gets interested in photography the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people during high school havent we seen that already too many times? goes to college at which point the film ends i kid you not this is the whole movie the mother becomes a teacher at a local college and always seems to attract the wrong guys the father is an unemployed loser who only talks about pop music and ends up being a square masons sister the directors daughter grows up too and thats pretty much all you can say about her it is actually impossible to spoil this film because nothing happens unless you consider the fact that mason finishes high school a spoiler linklater completely fails to dramatize his ideas as a result following this movie feels like watching family home videos of a family you do not care about  just with better picture quality instead of using form or contentdrama to make the film interesting boyhood refuses to do just that and therefore remains superficial you dont get to the essence of real life by only showing the surface of things everybody could do that it is really hard talking about this film because there isnt a single interesting character or scene in it you just follow ordinary events in the lives of these people stay away from this movie yes this review will get negative votes just because i didnt like the film unlike the critics union well none of those critics were able to offer a single insightful argument that would speak for this nonmovie in fact many even admitted the film lacked interesting characters or style but because of the 12yeargimmik they call it a masterpiece give me a break i would be willing to debate any of these pseudointelligent critics and tear them into pieces over and outscript 010 acting 110 dialogues 010 characters 010 environment110 special effects 010 marketing 1010 all those positive reviews are fake this movie is nothing but a good marketing campaign the first two hours were so boring that people started leaving the cinema apart from the giant wave at the end of the film there are no other special effects the robot is so primitive that you want to cry the director of this movie is hopeless just watch the ad on youtube and it will be enough entertainment for the poor and tastelessscience fiction fans dont need everything spelling out for them thats why the narration was removed from blade runner thats why 2001 a space odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes thats why r2d2 doesnt speak english and then theres interstellar matthew mcconaughey even takes the time to explain the origin of his daughters name to his daughters face this blunt method of explaining murphys law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which interstellars running time is so bloated by it is also the first of many inferior echoes of contact in contact james woods explains occams razor in a similar fashion however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place more significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from contact in which jodie foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father jessica chastains character here does likewise only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that its hard to sympathise with her the other female character in interstellar yeah theres only two also spends all her screen time pining after a man feminists  stay away another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to event horizon yes there really is a direct lift from event horizon this is where one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is it wouldnt happen like ever at least when sam neil gave the low down on wormholes in event horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was once again justified by context perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is tars a computer with delusions of being the next hal 9000 which is actually nothing more than metallic origami have i mentioned it knows a joke? yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times the joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage why watch this when you can watch contact 2001 a space odyssey or silent running? why go for christopher nolans take on dust bowl migration when you can read john steinbecks instead? on a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at you know like the cool graphics in the hobbit or transformersscene a semidarkened meeting room some people with dark robes are sitting around a table chairman ok people i present to you this years insult to human consciousness and spirit  this time in movie form you know we have popular hit music we have mainstream news socalled moviestars but we need a more open and direct insult to worthless masses as you know these masses are nothing more than viruses wait lets also use this line in the movie robed character #1 noted chairman good also dont forget to mention how we use tabloid news for communicating by the way feed the tinfoil cap trolls on international forums let them produce more disrespect and ridicule for truth seekers lately more people seem to be able to read symbols rc #2 can they understand that we ridicule them in plain sight once this movie is released? ch what? are you kidding? they still believe official stories for everything lets release this movie and youll see how many people will say hey this is great fun to watch people kill each other violently in blood fest humanity deserves wars and torture people the have no real respect for each other and for life did i say theyre like viruses? rc #1 yes master well add this line to the moviesave yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low iq its like the ideas been pieced together from other shows its stupid inconsistent hypocritical ridiculous and most of the acting is terrible its a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption you just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story linesave your money and your time except that the cgi moments were great but were better done in the new cosmos tv series and the film gravity this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring this certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in science fiction or fact i had problems enjoying this film on several levels 1 the annoying musical score never seemed to fit the moment bombastic 2 the overthetop soap operatype melodrama all characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears 3 the irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue especially michael caine 4 burning corn fields look like iraq oil fields on fire 5 after 23 years the watch left on the bookshelf still ticking and evidently keeping time 6 chasing speeding drone through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride 7 hollywood wildwesttype manomano fistfight between damon & mcconaughey in air tight space suits through a worm hole on an ice planet in another galaxy far far away 8 midway and unexplained appearance of the topher grace character 9 sets and props often looked like they were borrowed from ancient tv show twlilight zone 10 absolutely zilch onscreen chemistry among actors 11 poor ellen burstyn looking so artificial in all that heavy latex and make up i quit you get the picture of this picture awfulrented this movie over the weekend after oscar nominations and reading reviews etc i think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that linklater made a project of filming his daughteractress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic i cant understand how an actual documentary like hoop dreams gets snubbed not too mention selmas director getting snubbed but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy the novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds you watch them physically grow thats it thats the big wow factor of the film id of preferred to watch grass grow actually the acting and scenes seem forced and i couldnt figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? a documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining mason the sons character never really evolves the clich single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men has been done before keep in mind this is not a documentary this is a moviestory i couldnt help but think to myself while watching this film that i know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous i mean mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh masons first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? a commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? clearly im in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film i dont see the originality excellence in acting directing etc outside of using the same actors for 12 years one of which is the directors daughterrented this movie over the weekend

everything at times the big question is why? as a film in its own right its not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison despite being a liveaction rip why did we need this  sure on some level it may reach those who havent seen the original and dont want to watch an old anime but really  why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 2005? its not bad  its poor a poor relation of the original in the uk we often get 50th anniversary etc rereleases of old films nationwide admittedly not in all cinemas in fact cinderella monogatari was out a few years ago so the idea that a cheap copy is good because itll help open it up to new audiences the cast are all ok  until you watch the original anime overall its soso as a film however when you compare it to the original its really a poor show and because its a carbon copy you cant help but compare it line for line scene for scene actor for actorremakes are regular

philip glass from watchman 10* ?* story 2* way the story is given to us 10* logical error 100* really i love quantum theory but pointing logical errors i dont refer to quantum theory this movie is simply a 3h of melodrama  1h about the food is ending?? imagine the the day after tomorrow with the 1h intro about deadly force of cold  in one part of the movie the two people are traveling on foot faster than starship that is send after them   you can catch the drone by laptop when you driving a old car but you cant stop space ship having 2 supercomputers  apparently in the future gta is no problem because even the hangars do not have security?? no wait you have to use card and thats all the fly control  and the crew is sleeping?? there is plenty of others logical errors that cant let you watch the move so dont waste your money  you were warnedreally flynn? you treat your customers of your art like this? so bad empty no sense no closure just brutal way to treat us you are writing to entertain do that dont punish us with an ending you just cant figure out on your own  hire help im sure stephen king or dan brown could have given you a better ending  no charge the story moved along nice and you had me but the twist  it was good i think the hole in the script was the couple that stole money from amy they would have gone to the press probably sold their story once they realized who they stole money from i mean those kind of characters always do that? i actually thought thats what you would do wrong instead you killed 25 hours of my life plus another 10 minutes writing this dribble next time im reading spoilers for any of your stories to make sure i dont waste any more timereal life well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie life is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant for anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with their every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed it but then again why watch it what is the purpose in making movie about completely regular life of one functional but boring family at the end of the movie i started to value my time only because i lost three hours spending time with this people while i could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job as i am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all i wonderreading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that i watched the same movie everyone is gushing about the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome ie after trashing this planet lets go trash some others the black hole visualizations were quite lame this is not a great scifi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking nonscifi buff a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story these are yet to be made such as ringworld dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange although it is somewhat understandable as the aforementioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piecequite frankly one of the worst movies ive ever sat through forget the length forget the plot forget the acting the story was so far fetched and actually insulted the intelligence of the paying viewers this movie isnt even worthy of a review the acting was terrible across the board with the exception of rosamund pike even neil patrick harris was terrible ben affleck has some talent but ive never seen an actors talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other theres no redeeming value or consistency in anything affleck does those of you that are digging deep and sharing your views of the brilliance of this movie need to have a reality checkprobably the worst movie i ever seen ive just logged in to imdb to write this review i cant believe that this movie is on the top 250 top 250 of worst movies probably is the right list for this not into fantasy movies in general but there are some limits i didnt realize that there was any plot at all just some random scenes all around a galaxy its really sad that i cant vote 0 out of 10 regarding visual effects the picture was really nice and served in 3d but this was the only plus side of the whole experience boring trying hard to be fun but wasnt really and amuse a popcorn audience well hope we will not have a sequel for this nice wasted 2 hours of a sunday evening hope i will not see another  artwork like this in the near future i cant understand why the expendables are not on top of this movie its a crap title as well that should be popularpretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point cool thats it nothing else it was a clich scene after clich scene for almost three hours three hours which ill never get back  id rate it with negative 3 but theres no rating lower than 1 sometimes a movie starts bad it goes on for a while but then at the end something new and unique happens and you think oh i totally did not expect that so it was worth seeing it well not now bad start middle and end oh he met another girl really they like each other? is this how people who like each other act? the acting was so poor and just about every line said was said in so unnatural way real people in real situations simply do not look like or act like that i felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters none of them seemed to have any social skills none of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives they had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations the plot for such conversations goes like blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blahpretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point cool thats it nothing else it was a clich_ scene after clich_ scene for almost three hours three hours which ill never get back  id rate it with negative 3 but theres no rating lower than 1 sometimes a movie starts bad it goes on for a while but then at the end something new and unique happens and you think oh i totally did not expect that so it was worth seeing it well not now bad start middle and end oh he met another girl really they like each other? is this how people who like each other act? the acting was so poor and just about every line said was said in so unnatural way real people in real situations simply do not look like or act like that i felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters none of them seemed to have any social skills none of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives they had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations the plot for such conversations goes like blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blahpoor acting low budget poor cinematography boring predictable story line the mom of the tobis looked young enough to be his sister the leading female actor was the wrong person for the role she did not portray a rough and tough charactershe was just a pretty girl with the perfect eyelashes after a fight scene if you have not seen the first movie of this series do not go see this movie you will not under7stand what is happening and why you will be lost the movie also did not seem like 3d movie do not waste your money on this movie wait till it comes out on dvd trust me you will thank me for the advice duaneplease save yourself 3 hours of your life and read this before you watch this movie im sorry to those who want to say this was a profound moviei feel sorry for you this by far was one of the most unimaginative movies i have seen ever the continues praise of how real this movie is really? if i wanted to watch reality i watch a documentary there is a reason why we have documentaries and why we have movies this was not entertaining thought provoking or even remotely imaginative yes it took 12 years to make so what? i mean they had 12 years to think of a story? or give some meat to these actors to chew on i dont understand how there are so many awards and nominations this movie is getting its as if people who watch movies and who are suppose to be critics forgotten what a movie is suppose to be or how to be critical im not a critic but i have spent years and years watching movies and i can tell the difference between whats good and whats not whats art and whats sh*t rolled in glitter let me break it down story = none acting = uninspiring shallow character = one dimensional cinematography = point and shoot directing = great imaginative writing = none existent if a movie has no story no real depth in character or breaking boundaries in cinematic techniques then its not a good movie i do appreciate the fact that this is a unique movie in terms of its actual built but in terms of a movie no i didnt feel a second of inspiration when watching it and now feeling angry that its taken 3 hours of my life this years movies have been the worst in years at lease the positive side of things is at least it wont take me long to forget this movieplease dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will i only wish i could give it a zeroplease do not waste your time or money on this nonsense oh boy where do i start ok for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that neil patrick harris kidnapped her rosamund he did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn how does he even know of this location?????? but he makes such a p$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood and no one questions this even once no one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds oh and the hospital sends her home covered i mean a copious amount blood no flipping way the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much bloodi could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense i really wish imdb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1 i give this 5 for utter bull$h1*parents dont let your kids to see this movie it is a brain wash action to show evil is good and humans are bad maleficent it says is a fairy but she is looking nothing like one she is projected to be a demon and the images with her above clouds with black wings and huge horns trying to really brain wash people she is not a angel or a fairy most of the fairy creatures from the movie are ugly and same as the bad actress angelina are evil the movie is not pg should be pg13 at least someone or many are trying to change perspective of kids and kill the innocence dont be fooled by the special effects see behind the scene before is too late if is not alreadyoverall the movie was ok and i dont regret watching it it was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies as for the acting elle fanning was ok as aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair there wasnt much in the script to work with i wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness there actually wasnt much for any of the actors to work with i wont lie im no fan of jolies acting she comes across as haughty in every role humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range but her haughtiness works here and she was good as maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry i got no hint of her anger fire or passion she was merely shouting i wanted to feel her rage biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes there is no real explanation given for why the moors and the kingdom of men are enemies the king decides to attack for virtually no reason the relationship between stefan and maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of maleficents being we also see nothing of stefans life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens i could go on and on about things left with little explanation another major problem i had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way the movie wasnt a retelling of sleeping beauty from mealficents point of view it was an entirely new story i wanted to find out why maleficent was evil  the maleficent i know and lovehate or hatelove i wanted to see maleficents evil with new understanding lets face it maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie shes angry for a moment and thats it which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story perhaps humans had seriously wronged her aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that maleficents plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons  the story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale every story has two sides right? in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this movie if they were going to deviate so much from the known disney or perrault version they could have fleshed out the story a little lot moreoscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on boyhood flashback 11 years oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on lost in translation back to present im sitting here recalling the two worst movie decisions of my life craziest thing would be if boyhood actually wins best picture ha as we all watched our backsides getting numb we occasionally exchanged puzzled looks at each other as if to say what the heck is going on here? the movie much like its 11 year old predecessor made all of us ask how could we all be so different from the critics that raved about this movie its only claim to fame appears to be that it took so many years to film it duh we have things nowadays in hollywood called make up and multiple actors that pull off time changes with no problem  just look at benjamin button ive seen better hidden camera performances than this scripted documentary displayed i would believe that the director didnt have to say action hed just say act normally mason and nicole have a great little chuckle at the end of the movie they know what they just pulled off what a waste of time 35mm and moneyone of the worst movies ever painful for ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever take your pick overacted and pretentious moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean i never want to see anne hathaway again ever i only want to see mcconaughey was even worse if that is possible i feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie i formerly had respect for most of them some of the pictures were pretty cool too bad the dialog didnt rise to the level of the cinematography but neither did the storyline the characters were not fully developed in the story it was sillyone of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling i have ever seen in my entire life gone girl gets its title i think from the fact that she was supposed to be done away with murdered and disposed of but is really gone psychologicallyshe is a pure psychopath the movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent and meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it heres the pathetic execution of her plan 1 he leaves the house one morning and she springs into action 2 she breaks the glass coffee table pours about a half quart of her own blood in one puddle in front of the kitchen sink that much blood from a violent attack would be all over the room 3 she flees leaving the front door open 4 a nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband somehow the neighbor knows exactly where he is but no one saw the wife leave 5 the husband comes home he has not a scratch on him 6 he is totally cooperative with the police 7 they eventually find her diary in a wood stove at the husbands fathers house the wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only partially burned it really makes you wonder how that played outthat the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed all that work cleaning up the blood at home but not to burn the book as if he needed to make a special trip to his dads house to dispose of a stupid book and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one page which he couldve simply torn out 8 when the wife runs away she only changes her appearance slightly and then instead of secluding herself she makes friends with some lowlifes with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on tv 9 she murders the neil harris character in an attempt to switch the blame to him that would then imply he was the one that drained so much blood from her back at her home he cleaned it up and he put her diary in the wood stove ? his car wasnt seen at her house he then kept her a prisoner starved and raped heryet she found the opportunity and strength to kill him but didnt call the police from his house to come rescue her rather she jumps in his car and drives all the way home 10 upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged kidnapper 11 there is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping crime scenehouse on the lake 12 the hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform underneath which she is still caked in blood this movie is just about the lamest piece of s**** i have ever seenone of the lamest most unconvincing pieces of video material ive been subjected to my stepson said it was good so i gave it a try its shite ive loved comics since early childhood so its another reason why i thought this would appeal to me its so repugnantly fake im at a loss for words youll be hardpressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that its obnoxious actors on screen that youre watching i just dont know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 82 rating from the audience women drooling over the protagonist? kids into parkour and commercial tunes? im baffledone big disappointment i kinda liked divergent but insurgent tries way to hard to be the next hunger games the movie doesnt have a good story line and the acting performances of all the young actors was very bad especially shailene woodleys performance was unbelievably bad this movie tries way to hard to be the next hunger games but it fails at each part bad storyline bad acting and an uninteresting story is why i see this film as a big disappointment if you liked the hunger games you better wait until the next hunger games arrives in november sorry divergent fans but insurgent isnt going to be the movie of the yearomg this movie was so stupid like really waist of timei even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was the music at some parts was just so way over kill too loud and too way dramatic the whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense so ur telling us that nasa did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance ok the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character that was something interesting and his trying to dock into the space station it was nice story but still none nonsensical bc with time it just dont make any sense so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far no way they could of walk that distance then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways it just did not make any sense to me this movie its just way too stupid sorry but it wasi want my money backoliver may not be dead  f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season  my wife and i will not watch the series if oliver queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so  giving time to change the scenario  liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series oliver and felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series atomic  ant  is superman and thats what he needs to become in the series  if he has already put some superpowers  now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense just because the current craft shops in the series  giving the lowest rating oliver back okay this movie is a comedy right? okay i know that its says here on imdb that it is a drama mystery sci fi but it must be a comedy because the movie is totally laughable the script is totally laughable or worse its a kind of the lawnmower man from 1992 remakewhich was also laughable but you can forgive the lawnmower man for being a bad movie but this one you cant this movie is just like if someone gave a scientist 20 millions dollars so he could invent a technology that could turn cheese back too milk again a total waste of money i sincerely hope that mr depp and mr freeman has donated most off their money that they earned from this to doctors without borders or a children cancer foundation i once saw an interview with mr deep saying that he never goes to any premiere now i know whyokay so i am not one to judge tv shows it is not hard to please me when it comes to watching tv i watch a drastic range from the walking dead to the mentalist to family guy i absolutely adore superheroes and can not say enough about last year movies like the avengers dark night rises and so on so when i wasnt feeling well tonight and decided to stay home i found the perfect opportunity to check out this new show my sister recommended it and i saw the commercials the guy looked hot it looked full of action and seemed like a fun night the last show she recommended to me was revolution and i was not disappointed hmm what she failed to mention is that no one in this show can act the plot is not bad if looked at it overall but each episode is so boring there is no chemistry what so ever i had to force myself to watch eight episodes and i quit i was about to go to sleep when i got angry how the heck is this show doing well? seriously how is that good shows get canceled that actually have great characters plot and directing and this peace of ++++ is actually getting acclaim am i missing something?????okay lets make this simple this is perhaps the worst movie ever made it is more than predictable it so lacks originality that i not only figured out what was going to happen throughout the entire movie less than 10 minutes into it i even could tell you the lines of each character before they spoke them the highly touted fx? they were average at best and considering the budget of this film they could have been infinitely better the acting editing and cinematography were far from cutting edge the best part of this filmthat it ends but not nearly soon enough your best bet skip this movie watch the miniature golf tournament on espn2 insteadokay guys i gave this movie the lowest score possible for good reason so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise some horrible american actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date  her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters a tree a raccoon and a meat head who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt the acting is crap the story line is so obvious within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome as for the title guardians of the galaxy i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight they only save one planet sort of i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didnt waste a cent i would like to say a big eff you to whomever picked the cast to this point marvel has had amazing casts iron man thor  captain america? this movie taints marvel in their pursuit of profit they have created another flop do not bother watching this movieokay from where do i start? first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck & it seems my inner voice was right lol at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain its just so dead empty & jumbled that lacks everything oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie oh and movie is so stretched its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting & unrealistic plot its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk just avoid this movie do no waste your time on itok so i will start out by saying that i am a huge fan of the books and the series i love it this movie just made me extremely angry i burst out the theater exclaiming they ruined it they ruined it and i ranted on about it for about an hour or so after btw this is my strong personal opinion heres why i hate it so severely 1 it was extremely unfaithful to the book 2 they took out 90% of the books story and replaced it with an awful replacement book by far wins 3 this movie was dark and disturbing a lot of killing and pain and blood and several scenes were otherwise classified as dark my opinion 4 the box does not exist in the book the simulations to open this box do not exist in the book and i hated seeing jeanine torture the divergents 5 tris hates herself and thinks about killing herself i dont think thats a good message shes sending out for a main character to hate herself and think about killing herself may appear that its ok for people out there to feel and do the same and its not 6 the script was poorly written nothing else needed to add 7 the plot was extremely predictable i understand that a ton happens in the book but this way it isnt predictable and i get excited to turn each page in the movie you know what will happen oh this is a simulation even though they pretend it isnt oh they pushed her weak point of course she will do what they want her to do oh she did that yup i knew he would come oh i knew everyone would join yup i knew they would overpower him that sort of junk so there you go i dont want to come off like a hater but i thought it should be known especially with this movie that you should save your money and go buy some ice cream hope i helped a bit and didnt spoil to much =ok ill keep this brief but ill also nail my credentials to the mast first i know science cosmology scifi and filmmaking pretty well i have in the past taught film studies at degree level and worked on the production of more than one major hollywood scifi film i read stephen baxter and i like space stuff a lot more than a lot and why am i telling you this? because i should have loved interstellar but i didnt for one simple reason it is a truly dreadful piece of filmmaking i wont even bother with dissecting the science in the film because that isnt really the issue it is wrong on pretty much every level im not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix and ill ignore the substandard special effects  because fx dont a great movie make the issues i have with interstellar are essentially these the film is an arsenumbing three hours long and feels far longer the pace is stunningly poorly judged  the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost the characters are paperthin and i didnt care about any of them the plot is entirely derivative mostly of the vastly superior contact the special effects arent special at all and the editing or lack of is so selfindulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity the result is a plodding flabby and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact i wont go on but special mention must be made of the planets  paddling world and coldworld you see virtually nothing of either and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor cgi painfully inferior to a perfect storm and a location less dramatic than your own back garden ive probably not been a brief as i intended but as i write this i feel the disappointment and actual anger i felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again it was a total letdown and a waste of more than three hours of my life the gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd and i am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by i am fairly confident i didnt doze off although i desperately wanted to so in conclusion contact did all of this far far better fifteen years ago in contact the characters are human believable beautifully realised and you care what happens to them the relationship between father and daughter is deeply moving and inspiring but then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extraterrestrial life the science is accurate and entirely plausible it was written by carl sagan after all the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle and it has something very profound to say contact is everything interstellar is not and it has a considerably shorter running time contact brought tears to my eyes interstellar bored me to tearsok i was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high score and i wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema i cant say im a scifi lover but if films like blade runner only get 82 then this one should get 45 i watched gone girl the other day which is so much better than this one both in pacing and plot and that film only get 84how can this one get 9? another thing is the ending is too predictable and too sweet happy ending is good people love things that make them happy but in reality there never has a perfect ending like thatthe ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings also dont understand why made the brother a completely fool? he seems has nothing to do with everything? a contrast? to what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl sorry i even dont remember their names find out the secret which doesnt make sense to me anyway im disappointed and i dont want t say more about this film i fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacingi cant believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for meok i admit im a marvel fan seen almost all the movies and i know some movies are better than others i was quite surprised this movie got a 85 on imdb so it should be good right? my reaction after the last dance was seriously? marvel made this shyt? let me put this simple this movie steals like everything from the original star wars mixes an evil yonda not yoda in it together with pj the raccoon from over the hedge an ent living tree from lord of the rings and a little bit of star trek also the real bad guy gets the hammer of thor only a bigger one but thats a marvel studio idea already it could be a weird but good mixture but it ends up as a deadly cocktail where only the cgi is better than star wars and would actually deserve a better rating than 1 seriously this is a one to watch if you want to see marvels biggest blunder ever marvel isnt marvel if there wont be a sequel but i will skip that one on forehand leaves me to the question how the **** did this movie get a 85?oh my another science fiction film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life interstellar is a boring slow plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is cantt just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? wouldnt it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole? if people want drama there are a huge number of other much better films if i want to feel bad i will watch schindlers list if i want some good science fiction i will watch aliens is it that hard for people to get it? this was supposed to be a science fiction adventure for gods sake why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this overbloated sentimentalism this sacchariny mess? this is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead they laud anything that is over complicated with mindless twists with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius interstellar is another extremely over rated film it rivals prometheus in stupidity id rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it againoh lord where art thouã? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles for my little essay most of which were either political incorrect or simply too plain to use but still just a few what happened? or oh my balls or the peak of feminism or the extinction of mankindãetc so the point is that the story we all know well from our childhood got so many twists that you can easily forget it and look into the world of a totally other tale the evil fairy godmother back in the days just an innocent but strong young lady was betrayed by the pretentious young male whos aspiring for the throne of the kingdom of his own country since both of them are orphans no moral issues can interfere with their goals but while maleficent becoming a strong yet caring semigoddess of her realm her counterpart in the humans world still wants the throne but not through some noble deed but as a merit of his servitude evil humans preferably males claim the right for the neighboring country of fairies but fail miserably in their attempt and maleficent fends off the attack with no problem so the king puts a bounty on her head and who else but the onetime lover of the strongest fairies can seduce and bereft her from her wings so mother nature i mean maleficent becomes vengeful waiting for her time to come turning into the evil fairy weve all been waiting for in the meantime for his servitude the little orphan becomes the king of his homeland forgetting about his fairylover and marring a beautiful human being who has all the characteristics of a devoted humble wife she gives life to the young princess aurora and actually her part of the story ends here we never see her again the storyline shows only here some reminiscence of the original tale maleficent bestowing the little child with her curse but from there the story evolves into another path maleficent carefully watching over her cursed goddaughter since the inapt fairies are unable to fulfill their task as babysitters little aurora becoming a young innocent blooming lady caring for nature and her surroundings not knowing of her true origin meets maleficent by chance and the two becoming friends  once maleficent even trying to withdraw her own curse while she is asleep she cannot but prince charming is already on his way giving hope that the one with pure heart can wake her up in the event she should sting herself with the spinningwheels needle which she doesã the prince with the help of maleficent gets into the castle and tries to wake aurora with his kiss but fails so comes maleficent kisses her on the cheek begging for forgiveness and my ohmy the young girl awakens from her sleep now that was the point where all those titles came into my mind and as the castle is brittle and princess aurora has already found her home in fairy land the two attempt to escape from her fathers home but ambush lurks around and poor maleficent gets trapped with iron net luckily aurora manages to escape from her own fathers castle ?? and a fierce battle ensues between maleficent and the king although at the end of the battle maleficent cries its over the king still wants to kill her but falls into his death after that maleficent reinstalls the once lovely garden of eden eh i mean fairyland and the two maleficent and aurora lives happily ever after somewhere in the background we can see prince charming i forgot his real name the characters nameã but with no special role in the set now aurora as the new queen of fairyland i mean i honestly believe that women should be more involved in the building of our society and equal rights and alike but come on this is an offense against all male viewers not a single time had i the feeling of seeing a positive male character not even the young prince who was more like a puppet for the will of maleficent in this world men are either aggressive or caring only for themselves but does not poses any kind of positive characteristics for which we could support them in such world male are only there to fulfill their task of fertilizing otherwise they have no earthly use females can live happily without males who can only bestow them with sadness and regret i guess this is the kind of attitude which turned this world into a hostile selfish hell not even orwell imagined in his wildest dreams the sheer evilness of the male characters who sometime selfpitying themselves for their own weakness is so onefolded that a paperbag is more versatile than thatã all in all the modern adaptation of the story find out the truth as the trailer puts itã is not just disappointing but shows the zeitgeist in such mannerism that one should throw upãsorryã females should be left alone with their fragile souls and naivety and only bothered by men if they humble enough to serve their needs trust me i am not a malechauvinist but after this piece of ãfilm i honestly dont know what to do with my manhood?oh lord where art thouó? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles

have no earthly use females can live happily without males who can only bestow them with sadness and regret i guess this is the kind of attitude which turned this world into a hostile selfish hell not even orwell imagined in his wildest dreams the sheer evilness of the male characters who sometime selfpitying themselves for their own weakness is so onefolded that a paperbag is more versatile than tható all in all the modern adaptation of the story find out the truth as the trailer puts itó is not just disappointing but shows the zeitgeist in such mannerism that one should throw upósorryó females should be left alone with their fragile souls and naivety and only bothered by men if they humble enough to serve their needs trust me i am not a malechauvinist but after this piece of ófilm i honestly dont know what to do with my manhood?oh imdb seriously? i trust your ratings and always check before deciding whether to watch or not i was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of godfather the shawshank redemption the lord of the ring series goodfellas star wars and likes its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value just because you took 12 years filming this doesnt mean you get to get a 99% rt and an 84 imdb without deserving it okay let me see what was this movie about? nothing 12 freaking years of shooting for what? what really happened there? first of all there was no plot no story whatsoever it shows look a boy was 9 playing with his sister fighting with his sister eating macaroni going to bathroom he got taller grew his hair he cut them back grew them again hes eating going to bathroom again drinking kissing a girl breaking up with a girl going to college oh come on thats what kids do they grow up right? the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever hes not a hero not a zero not a lover not a loser not a fighter not even a dreamer theres nothing about this character that will pause you and let you think about it mr linklater couldnt even catch any memorable scene out of it i appreciate his movie shooting technique but there should be more of it since boyhood supposed to be a story about a boys life his inner world his feelings his dream or his struggle growing up his happinesssadness but there is no depth at all for instance i was once a kid now im grown up i saw my life then how my times were my thoughts my actions my dreams etc it could have been like mason as boy how were his thoughts by the time he was growing up what changes he had to face in his adulthood how he struggled or how he enjoyed what was his dream how he adapted with his struggling family instead mr linklater showed some ordinary does not mean they needs to be extraordinary folks leading lives where nothing happened at all this is a not a growing up story this is certainly not a movie about teenage crisis in fact this movie is about nothing so thats the point? call this 12yearsgimmick a masterpiece? oh come on give me a breaknothing we havent seen you already know is about ai so the first 15 minutes resembling robocop or any other futuristic movie are slow with nothing to add to the plot all along the movie you already know whats going to happen there is no twist at all i can summarize it in one sentence ai goes out of control in the most lineal way visual effects are ok but very repetitive there must be at least 10 shots of people healing themselves after getting shot it reminded me of zombie movies i cant understand why guys like bradd pitt with world war z or johnny depp with this movie are taking part in these kinds of productions what a disappointmentnote if you read my review please vote so that i know if you found my review helpful or not for that matter thanks this movie has johnny depp  this statement alone should suffice but for the sake of humanity i will try to elaborate many years from now if the world is destroyed by nucular holocaust global warning or some such calamity and then an alien ship lands on earth and them aliens get to watch transcendence most probably on bluray with high definition surround sound from the cloud they will regret not reaching the earth earlier they will also have to accept the fact that they could never reach the level of mankind after watching this movie they would laugh if someone told them that marlon brando and lawrence olivier were probably some of the best actors this movie proves that usa movie industry is million miles  no light years  ahead of bollywood movie industry if you just read the end credits you will know that my statement is true never has bollywood been able to have so many americaan names in their credits whereas this movie alone has screens full of bollywood cgi guys if this trend is continued after sometime hollywood will have no technicians to work with and have to give up moviemaking altogether some jealous people have mentioned that this movie is a copy of bicentennial man which is an outright lie transcendence is absolutely fundamentally different from bicentennial man for example the scientist in bicentennial man does not wear glasses also the robot there is not called dr will caster for those others who say that transcendence has borrowed from i robot and twlight zone etc i say only two words cia conspiracy oops i so sound like kevin trudeau i strongly believe that cia used some covert technique such as staring at goats to extract the thoughtwaves of depp as he claimed he has been planning for this movie for the past 10 years and then has given those ideas to bollywood movie makers to diminish american read hollywood achievement even when hollywood makes a movie entitled dances with wolves there is no wolves dancing in the movie and that alone shows how far ahead the tamil film industry in comparison to hollywood is some reviewers have stated that this movie would win all the oscar awards one has also mentioned cannes since movies such as terminator godzilla i robot transformers and others  all of which are made based on concepts stolen from parts of endhiran by a method i mentioned earlier hint cia was involved  have won so many oscar and cannes awards transcendence is bound to surpass them all by winning in all categories at the oscars and cannes negative points the only negative point of this movie is its short length this movie should have been at least 6 hours long for detailed character development and other aspects if simple movies such as once upon a time in america which neither had songs nor cgi could be 4 hours long transcendence the greatest movie ever made surely should have been at least 6 hours long on second thought i also think that the number of songs is too less for such an epic movie with the honorable mr depp sorry if the spellings are wrong note if any of you would like to say something personally to me you may please write to me at pinchashodi at yahoo com thanksnot worth a visit to the theater totally clumsy and amateurish ignorant of the most basic cinematography completely out of pace absolutely no sense of time rendering the plot is so unstructured that its just a mess eg we are introduced to the prince then he disappears then he reappears and thats it so lifeless that editing seems like the land of lost opportunities there no actual interplay between scenes they just follow one another in mere succession no character development for example you get no sensible feel of who the three fairies are and why they behave like they do a repetitiveness of emotions the scenes with maleficent and the beauty are the same and the same and the same no escalation nowhere throughout youd expect the scene where maleficent becomes who she is to be a tower of power but no they could not even get a single scene right the final battle is so out of rhythm that its just a bore instead of having your beat rising the storyline is just a plain line to sum up it feels like a high school production of a play written by children in all this mess angelina could be nothing but flat as if steppedover by an elephant just a long puzzled snore shame cause it really could be an awesome movie but thats what you get when you hire a guy robert stromberg who has never directed before  for your 200000000 movie and they say hollywood is conservative and unadventurous i m pretty sure that the 75 is not untouched after all it cost 200000000 and they have to make sure they get their money back i m also sure that after it runs its course the real rating will be revealed to be much worsenot that funny at all it was a total embarrassment this was one of those movies in which i wish i could have put a bag over my head while walking out the theater because i was too embarrassed for people to see that i had gone to this movie the good ol f word seems to make up most of the script the movie was filled with stupid scenes very little of anything original came out of this film i thought the scene with freebird blasting would never end this was just plain embarrassing tell the writers and producers to please make some better movies than this im really trying to forget i went to this movie so this gets two thumbs downnot sure how this movie has such good reviews it is one of the most boring and dumb movies i have ever seen in my entire life this is 2 12 hours of my life i will never get back do yourself a favor and dont waste your time on this garbage i honestly gave it a shot i watched the thing the whole way though about 14 of the way through the movie i really wanted to turn it off it just didnt keep my interest the ending makes it even worse and just puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie i am glad i didnt go to see this in the movies because i would have demanded to get my money back i am usually pretty open minded when it comes to movies there have been a few ive seen that are like wow that was terrible this is definitely one of those in my opinionnot only did everything happen way too fast it didnt make much sense either as it was told to us near the end he was the more or less same person as before death doing everything not because of his own desire but because of the women he lovesd what she wanted was explained and he did exactly that being able to heal the planet being able to cure diseases and injuries enhance and watch over literally everything just why in the name of pickles did he decided to throw everything away? his processing capabilities were supposed to be beyond comprehension and the best thing he could come up with was basically sending the world back to the stone age? and people were actually lining up behind this idea? lets see no communication no worth of money no medication no order no disaster recovery its the end of economy so what comes are spreading sicknesses starvation maybe a few wars here and there just to spice it up a little its pure chaos and anarchy nothing more so against the wishes heal the planet to help people of the most important person to him against his owndesire to keep her alive he was like ah screw it that the blondie wouldve shot the other guy my apologies im not good with names is yet again irrelevant with the power at his fingertips he wouldve been able to recover him as well but killing off his love himself and probably billions more is sure a better idea and please dont try the people fear what they dont know or they were scared it would take over the world bull**** because with just an ounce of intelligence theyd have realized that the upcoming suffering and deaths of this new dark age and more suffering and deaths in this still imperfect world is no better option than the worst case scenario the hive mind and loss of individuality order prosperity and evolution again that was the worst case scenario which was not at all the case personally i find it difficult to understand his everything but logical decisions to put it lightly for me this movie was simply horrible an awful experience ps i do not exactly care about the actors the acting the serenity the animations or anything elseat all i am talking about the story the plot nothing elseno spoiler needs to be flagged here it was spoiled from the start 165 minutes of nothing a waste of film and 13 years i havent watched a movie boring in years at best patricia arquette was almost ray light however the movie was so bad i even got tired of seeing her if i had rented this movie at redbox for $1 it wouldnt have been worth it cartoons have more depth im not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a golden raspberry since it took 13 years you could give the golden raspberry for lifetime achievementno need for a spoiler here the ending is so bizarre unbelievable and pretentious it is the type of ending a hollywood director on lsd might make that being said nolan does make the 5th dimension a realitystupidity i cant believe the yawning of 10s and 9s i guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore if you believe that movies should be believable coherent and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move period so my advice to you is simple read the book first oh wait there is no book? that is because there isnt a publishing company that would print it let me give you a line from the movie and you tell me if it is worth seeing who are they? i dunno but they are real and wanted us to be here that is because we are they oooookaaaynever posted on imdb before and i never thought i would but this time i had to i am a movie buff watched thousands of films and i love it i was looking forward to this movie great reviews and 84 on imdb i never read reviews listen to my friends or ever watch trailers because i like going in with a clean slate thats when ive had my best film experiences try it this movie is garbage i love finchers work but he failed miserably at this one so the movie starts out as an interesting dramathriller with the usual effects then it turns over to black comedysatire with the same direction?? i couldnt believe the last third ive never seen this many plot holes in any movie unbelievable garbagemy goodness where do we start? first of all the many 10s this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3yrold nolan must know nothing about real science he bandies wormholes and anomolies around like he really knows what they are had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all just shows that putting big hollywood stars in a movie doesnt guarantee a good product in the end i wont go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60s show lost in space will robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie the biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on yet they didnt even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all his kids are grown but they still live in the same run down house and michael caine who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back and the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested every time they tried to say something intelligent the audience laughed no one in the theater took this movie seriously at all sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science bottom line this was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors what a wastemost overrated show ive seen ever i know that a lot of tv is awful but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream dumbed down hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe however i did not know that the amount of people who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge imdb used to be still is in many cases its a good site either way a reliable source for figuring out whether a showfilm was worth looking into put seeing the high ratings of arrow which is 82 at the time of this being written and the latest hunger games movie ive lost hope the spoiler free premise rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad hes got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline boat sinks everyone dies except him he manages to maroon himself on an island during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms he makes a bow out of what he can find on the island gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him well this doesnt seem too bad leaving out some of the backstory and other revelations of course but for some reason he is now a parkour master with martial arts skills hacking skills did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a windturbine? now what he should have done on that island is trained on his damn acting because it blows if i was an actor in la trying to make a name for myself i would of bought the boxset and hit myself in the head repeatedly until i died from head trauma but if that isnt horrible enough the entire cast share the most stale unnatural awful awful acting abilities as the lead it wouldnt have surprised me if the director got blown by every single member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show its just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an actionshow too bad dramas require acting which the cast does not suffice to provide it should be called bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business instead of acting in this case the style of this series is extremely similar to smalville with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better which is the one thing they actually can do for the most part with the oily 80s pornflick filter and the halfarsed special effects though smallville actually being a half decent show gets a pass there was one scene i laughed out loud at it wasnt actually the scenes where the directorwriter intended it to be funny because those scenes were so tryhard funny that i literally cringed it was a scene where mr arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic bad guys head the bad guy says hah you missed whereas mr arrow replies i didnt lol apparently he shot the the arrow which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip into the usb slot behind the bad guy which also contained a virus which mr arrow had taught himself to program on the island or something? which brought down the evil database epic haha great writing indeed no clichs included i actually dislike this series so much i feel good writing how awful it is maybe i can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad tldr horrendous acting clichridden awful holeridden unoriginal and uninspiring writing horrendous acting overrated by people who would drink the koolaid as long as the trailer had explosions in it directing and special effects on high school film project standards thats actually insulting to high schoolers since they actually have creativity sorry acting horrendous terrible makeup jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries

schoolers since they actually have creativity sorry acting horrendous terrible makeup jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries acting horrendousmission impossible indeed im still trying to understand this movies plot every other minute some guy takes off a mask so i had a very difficult time understanding who are the good guys and who are the bad guys and im not stupid i think the creators of this film went a little bit too far in trying to surprise the viewer all they achieved is a lot of confusion if youre interested in watching a surprising and understandable movie go watch the gamemindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else guardians delivers none of that throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script ive never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of guardians is just so hilariously godawful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits oh christ what a forgettable uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was i suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but i struggle to see how theres hardly any character development the plot is nonsense from start to finish the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce thanos who is a big deal im assuming? and its all just so damn predictable perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired power of love trope i may have given guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it but none of that is to be found heremementothe dark knight trilogy the prestige inception and moneyball there all pretty decent films wouldnt you say? one thing that all those films had in common is the fact they were all overseen in a dop sense by renowned cinematography wally pfister dont even try say that last name correctly christopher nolans go to cinematographer until his recent upcoming interstellar working with nolan on his modern day classics wouldve taught you a thing or two about the thinking mans blockbuster wouldnt you say? well sadly with transcendence it looks like wally didnt listen in class looking to debut his directing career with a scifi not dissimilar to the large thinking themes of inception pfister has gone for the knockout straight away and left himself completely exposed to the blows that a weak storyline shoddy editing and mismanaged performances will deal out transcendence looks to delve deep into the modern day tech filled world that is increasingly blurring the lines between what it is to be human and human emotion being overtaken by artificial intelligence its a high end concept and a concept no doubt ripe for exploration yet pfister doesnt lay hold on any firm grip of his subject that gets lost in an uninteresting love story badly played jumps in time and a finale that not only feels rushed but feels horribly underdeveloped much like the movies performances stealing previous nolan acting collaborators in the forms of rebecca hall still crying out for a decent role cillian murphy morgan freeman and lucas haas its clear that pfister was able to draw some serious talent to his tale mix these actors in with johhny depp paul bettany and kate mara and the recipe was all there to provide one of this years most unique and intriguing ensembles the cast however here is universally terrible working with material that is clearly underdeveloped the increasingly acting for hire type role by johnny depp comes off worse as will caster but there is no one staking a claim here for acting honours in what is a showcase for pfisters inability to draw out commanding performances something his teacher nolan has always been able to achieve transcendence has a few neat visual tricks up its sleeve which is to be expected for a man whos given us some of recent cinemas most iconic imagery but even these flourishes cannot paint over the fact that the film is a complete mishmash of half cooked ideas uninteresting dramatics and weak acting efforts somewhere deep inside this tale something is waiting to burst to life but this is one startlingly bad debut by a cinematographer that should be on the phone to some of his old mates begging for his job back as his latest career move looks to have stalled before it really even began half an abnormal raindrop out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check out

dust cloud follows the pickup as they plough through the cornfield chasing a drone this is a totally unexplained encounter the family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind yet fast enough to keep up with a jetpowered drone hello??? no intelligible explanation for how mm landed the drone what he found in it how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission why should michael caine be the nasa project director  he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist why such a bizarre robot? and did it wake them all up before the worm hole  or did i miss how that was to happen in the mumbles lo and behold  despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near saturn they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end but i guess that was the work of them it is key to the plot but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years and how come the open sea is paddleable and a vast tsunami appears? despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but id lost interest it is the moment i walked out the movie to that point was uninteresting and wholly illogical i really thought with all the hype it would be compelling instead it was plain irritating anne hathaway was okay at least we could hear what she was saying and we could hear everyone else for that matter poor miscast good ol boy matthew i have now read the wikipedia synopsis which is likewise unintelligible and am hugely glad that i left  even though i have wasted one hour of the two hours i saved by writing this reviewman oh man this movie was terrible how this got an 86 is beyond me and in fact thats what i went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies hollywood pumps out there is nothing to this movie i went with a friend and i literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over its just an empty movie all action with no story nothing just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes all recent movies like this including the new amazing spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why i refuse to pay for movies in theatresmaleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting that let you escape from your normal everyday world it even had some good performances but besides that dont even waste a dollar at redbox to see this piece of crap what in the world got into their head that made them warn to change the original character? in order to change that character they had to reroute the entire storyline and transform beloved strong willed characters into weak and stupid characters or good willed characters into evil one dimensions ions psychopaths and make a very important character pretty much pointless to the story okay from here on there are spoilers if you have not seen the movie do not read on maleficent was changed into a weak and clichd piece of crap character to try in promote strong female roles in other films but she was only taken to a deeper level of weakness in the original she was strong and evil and she didnt have to have a back story because her story wasnt the main story she even turned into a stinking dragon in this version she was symbolically raped then she went all stereotypical and clich strong girl on us and decided to get revenge on her ex lover only this time she just cursed his daughter come on i mean thats not even exact revenge thats just stupidity if i were her idve killed the sucker immediately and just not worry about the daughter and then she tries to help the girl age cursed by attempting to break it how does being an antagonist with a heart of gold translate with audiences? uh not very well on top of that they changed her into a hero halfway through for no good reason at all except to make disney happy so its not like ultra dark unfortunately while doing this they ruined the dragon not only was maleficent not the one that transformed into the dragon it only took the soldiers like a total of 30 seconds to bring it down i mean seriously i counted then to top off this review i cant forget prince phillip the strong hearted prince who comes to save his true love for the evil sorceress only in this version hes a random guy who says hello to aurora once then gets this absurd infatuation with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even need an explanationmaleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting that let you escape from your normal everyday world it even had some good performances but

with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even need an explanationmaleficent is the very first movie in my long list of movies that i have seen that i wanted to walk out of lets start with the positives angelina jolie was incredible she was beautiful she was strong and she executed maleficent beautifully her relationship with aurora was refreshing and nice the magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia but it was still beautiful and engaging but all of this does not save the movie i expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked where we get a better understanding of the bad guy yes us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done but we can see where they come from in the musical wicked and even in the movie great and powerful oz we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy we could see where she was coming from in those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming the bad guy most were victims of circumstances in maleficent? it was ferngullyavatar all over again magical people good man baaaaaad instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her he was given no aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy not the smallest bit of understanding he was just a vile man that broke maleficents heart mutilated her and cared only for power even when he tried to protect his daughter it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved yes he graveled for her for a bit begging maleficent not to curse her but that was it the movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it ok it had some of the good of humanity but the only human that was portrayed as good was aurora the movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief but ended up just portraying them as idiots incompetent selfish creatures the fairies in the original disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life if were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand then yes we would be as lost as they were but they were given 16 years to evolve to learn and to grow but no the fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie they were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie i mentioned before that i liked the relationship that maleficent and aurora had in the movie but even that was shattered later on in the movie the solution to the problem was not a surprise at all it was taken straight out of frozen it was refreshing and incredible when frozen did it because it was the first time disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of true love but when the same solution the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? it is boring and in no way exiting it is in no way entertaining we have learned nothing new is this disneys new approach in relationship? love between man and a woman is obsolete but the love between girl family kind of love not lesbian kids apparently cant handle that and also family excludes male family members at this moment as well only women can feel true loveis the strongest of all the loves in this world in the end the movie basically told the audience yeah the moviestory that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda and i should know because i am queen aurora and i was there all along the original sleeping beauty was rather black and white good vs evil when i walked in to the theatre i expected the lines to be blurred to be thought all stories have two sides not all of our actions are blatantly good or evil but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible the good creatures are good no matter what they do and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way in conclusion the movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain just switching the genders around the worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the endmaleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title characters personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale in disneys new maleficent we first see maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings she is the largest fairy and protector of the magical moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom she meets a human stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful humannature this is the new and unknown backstory that motivates the maleficent we know from the animated disney narrative children will enjoy this movie it is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it there is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed the film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within maleficent the plot is flimsy weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized nothing makes any sense and the title characters behavior is neither explained with a backstory nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding the writers try to make you believe that maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal and by her closest most trusted loved one there is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by angelina jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated no wonderful love story involving the future king stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor there is a nice sentiment behind the makers intentions but the entire story is unrefined like a first draft director robert stromberg is new and it shows he lacks the confidence ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story the writer linda woolverton is most at fault in her creation of a feeble unconvincing and baseless story executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with gregory maguire then there would be an intelligent logical but beautiful plot and woolverton could do what she does best create a screenplay to match now for the worst party of the film the fairy god mothers oh dear lord what have they done to the fairy godmothers? they are flighty imbecilic selfabsorbed twits since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising aurora is explained with an impractical sentence as is most of the film then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges elle fanning is not the

matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil i am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? no im guessing stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity and thought that sufficient with a flimsy story bad acting and a complete disregard for the storys structure the whole thing is preposterous is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really

to connect with the generation he attempts to portray hell use a pop song or a shot of an ipod or some other cheap reference to suggest a specific moment in time but his perspective is that of an ignorant adult oversimplifying or completely misinterpreting the internal experience of childhood maybe thats why so many critics identify with the film because they like many adults suffer from the same disillusionment when failing to understand young people today and why are there so many onedimensional characters in this film? this is inexcusable the lead actor the sister the mother the two alcoholic step fathers the girlfriends the most interesting character is by far the dad played by ethan hawke who is actually a complex human being like the rest of us who grows always trying to guide his son and impart wisdom where he can even when unqualified everyone else is a shadow of a borderline offensive clich why arent more critics mentioning this? the lead was clearly cast because he was a goodlooking kid there obviously isnt a single acting bone in his body he doesnt even seem interested in anything there is a dull lifelessness in his performance i cant help but think linklater views teenagers as dull lifeless emotionless creatures i give the filmmakers credit for experimenting with their creativity and committing to the process but is this really the best picture frontrunner?

really the best picture frontrunner? really??? with this script? these performances? seriously?looking the reviews i thought it was worth a watch the 1st hour was not too bad  highlights of the usual family problems in american culture etc  but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing while the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique there wasnt much of a plot other than this is what its like in real life in which case it would be a documentary but it was not there was a good introduction in the 1st houri was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go but not much buildup no climax and no resolution pretty disappointing to what i thought might be a good storylisten im not a smart man but i have basic reasoning skills and common sense now whilst i understand that scifiction doesnt follow the rules of reality suspension of disbelief and all there still has to be coherency rules and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie this movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewers intelligence in one snippet of the three hour nonsense youll endure and i do mean endure the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time but decades of earth time well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadnt sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place after all how could she know that in the mere minutes between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?? nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion hey guys i just landed here looks great come now xoxo then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a oneway trip to scout a planet then chicken shis out when he gets there and realizes its not viable and hes a dead man so selfishly dooms mankinds one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself holy whiplash with his conflicting moralitiesimmoralities batman i could go on and on but i wont i conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when its really just acid tripping rubbishlike many others i was shocked by how bad this movie was and the many plot holes its hard to know where to startamy being sent home from the hospital still covered in blood was one low point i also agree with the earlier reviewer who says the movie is antifemale empowerment it makes the commentators on tv talking about domestic violence seem like the enemybecause you know at that point the husband is wrongly accused so you see the women talking about husbands murdering wives on the pseudonancy grace talk show as false accusers and man haters very disturbing however i wrote this review to point out one plot hole one very big plot hole nobody else seemed to notice again spoiler here amy is a psychopath supposedly the whole story turns on the idea that she is sociopathic and abusive and has been for years witness her framing of the exboyfriend 8 years earlier why then does she givelend her parents almost her entire trust fund simply because they ask? it is already established that they care more for fictional amazing amy than for her her reason at the end of the day the trust fund is really their money huh? thats how a psychopath sociopath thinks about parents she doesnt like? or was it part of her evil plan all along to end up broke in missouri so she could start to hate her husband and try to frame him? sarcasm its just dumb how did this movie and book get such great buzz? i left the movie wondering sadly is this what people like now? btw i watched this with a largely college age audience who laughed several times especially when amy flips her nonbloodsoaked blond hair at the end of the bloody murder scene at then laughed again when the credits were rollinglike many others i was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen almost all the elements which made the tv series mission impossible so entertaining  the team ethos the complex contricks etc  were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is mr tom cruise it is particularly annoying given that the plot chosen to replace it is so bogstandard and predictable an honest hero is framed for something he didnt do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy this seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days  two titles released just before mi using exactly the same storyline spring to mind judge dredd and schwarzeneggers eraser it was also totally unnecessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie  can you imagine a film version of the untouchables with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss eliot ness? there is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure one feels that it would like to be a coldwar style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end i could go on but at the end of the day my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective and dont really point to this being a bad film simply one that i dont like but then suddenly it struck me the reason i find this movie so intensely pointless and the reason i think its no good is that so many scenes are so stupid or just completely extraneous take for example the films most memorable moment  the break in to the cia building to steal half of the noc list we are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world that it has every security system known to man except it seems a plain and simple good old cctv camera sure the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it but if you take a step back to think its preposterous besides by my reckoning there is no reason for hunt even to have the real noc list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy so the scene shouldnt even be there why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? nit picking? certainly but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time there are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain and then doesnt even stand up to scrutiny i find the whole process deeply depressing  more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does i cant even be entertained anymore because i am acutely aware of how shallow empty and ultimately pretentious it all is so sorry folks but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a macguffin wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas all designed for the sole purpose of making tommy look good its a real shame that the supporting cast production values direction etc are all so high since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless at my most generous id give it 410like many other reviewers im giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s i keep seeing even though i really think it deserves a 5 or maybe a 6 i actually created an account just to do this so i figured i might as well include a review along with my rating many will say try to tell you that you shouldnt attempt to compare this movie to 2001 that they are two totally different movies etc this is ridiculous they are quite similar on multiple levels with interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from kubricks masterpiece i feel that if we compare the two we can get a good idea of where nolans film went wrong the main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesnt try to explain and rationalize everything that happens we see the events of the movie unfold but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on has he entered another dimension? an alternate universe? an alien spacecraft? is he just dead? the mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual something scientifically quantifiable or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time interstellar answers far too many questions which as is often the case ends up raising infinitely more nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one then why even bother have the film fact checked by a astrophysicist? why create this confusing mixture of real and pseudo science in the first place? to me in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism nolan seemed to be going for the floating bookcase in a black hole sequence for instance seemed really magical until cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans not aliens that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5d and communicate with his daughter and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity boom there goes all the mystery and lets assume his theory is correct and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future hmmm guess it turns out that we didnt perish from constant dust storms after allinstead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mindblowing interdimensional space technology then what exactly is future us so worried about? they seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions youll find in this movie if you have a very analytical mind steer clear of iti am not a mathy or sciencey person by any stretch yet even i struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride thats what id advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie dont overthink it if you can just do that youll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects a great if maybe a little too over the top score from hz and very convincing performances from the actors i found some scenes very moving i liked the concept of a future that as a result of a technological lull doesnt look very different from our present there are a lot of positive things to say about this film and yet the end result is sadly maybe just a couple pegs above mediocrelike its protagonist kenneth branaghs liveaction adaptation of the disney animated classic cinderella proves

even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cashinlet me start by saying that maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to disney villains throughout her many interpretations she has simply been evil yes with a capital e so forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant in this adaptation she is reinterpreted as a good fairy because shes apparently not a human sorceress anymore? that simply has a hissyfit she is certainly not evil  just angry for a little while she even ends up becoming a godmother?? even king stephens character is butchered why does he go insane over her? if he were really the bad guy why wouldnt he have killed maleficent when he had the chance? what possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter? speaking of aurora its worth mentioning that she is relatively alright but still not too close to her original character a petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color which is really distracting additionally they rehash the concept from frozen which is that true love doesnt have to be from some man if this trend continues from disney all well see is sisterlygodmotherlyfamily love movies where romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesnt end with a happily ever after anymore overall this film was simply horrible if you respected maleficent as a villain if you did like maleficent as she was i dont recommend seeing this movie even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as evil i urge you not to see this movie dont support the people who made itlet me start by saying that i have enjoyed christopher nolans work in the past memento insomnia parts of the batman trilogy i find him a very talented filmmaker with strong ideas and visual sense therefore it makes me very sad to state that categorically this is an absolute turkey in many places the plot is so full of holes that you can do little but laughout loud there will be reviewers on here talking about depth intimations of mortality etc etc forget it this is just a total misfire actors used to say despairingly that they were playing johnny exposition  you know the guy who explains everything to the audience note i said despairingly this has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the mystery of love oh yeah after a totally boring drawnout beginning which seems to be there to prove that nolan has watched the grapes of wrath many times over we get the first huge laugh when we meet sir michael caine with a laughable posh  cockney  american accent he is playing the part that sam shephard in this or morgan freeman usually play he is not up to it never was never will be it takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudoscientific gobbledygook and make it sound real caines performance  like so many of his performances  screams out wheres my bleedin paycheck? when coop gary cooper  westerns  get it agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space he blasts off like a cosmic cowboy all bravado and charisma  at which point his fellow crew member shows him  with a pen and paper  what a wormhole is yes when he is leading a flight into outer space a little late doncha think? it gets worse when poor anne hathaway playing as my son said  science girl has to recite a monologue about love and how it can cross all dimensions of space time blah blah blah i really felt for her i wont expand on the plot i couldnt if i wanted to and the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved this is not one of those films that you see and forget immediately you will wake up in a few months time laughing at michael caines last scene or his recital of dylan thomas famous lines  not once but twiceand the end oh the end mcconaghey gives it his all having to cry on more than one occasion  believe me i know how he felt dont believe anyone if they tell you you didnt get it thats like saying you didnt get an episode of two and a half men ambitious yes but a turd is a turd  even if they meant to produce a new hybrid roselet me start by saying im certain i would more than struggle to make a better film i am humbled by the energy love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes i also consider myself a huge fan of the nolan brothers following memento the prestige inception all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling for years christopher nolan has worked literal movie magic telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded interstellar begins no different nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise but unlike previous masterpieces interstellar drags the audience on a painful bumpy ride through space time love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder the rest simply insulted wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes stay a message delivered by cooper to his daughter across space and time and yes we knew it was him all along stay the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear stay home its safe and warm revisit memento the prestige or inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again perhaps next time the nolans will deliver on that hope until then stay away from interstellarlet me just say that the plot is good the story seems cool the message is good but when you start watching the movie it just gets worse and worse till the end it is a complete waste of time giving you nothing but a bad taste in your mouth this movie really sucks anyone who thinks this movie is great has never seen a good scifi movie before or is on drugs or being paid matthew mcconaughey keeps mumbling threw out the movie absolutely cannot stand the irritating music that booms on boring things trying to keep you interested in actors that dont even do a good job i mean matt? seems like a amateur everyone seemed very lame and there are no aliens there is no life there is nothing to make you go wow you see the same people doing a lot of nothing hoping they all get killed so the movie will end and the logic the science they screw up on their mission and some of the special effects are worse then 1960s doctor who the only thing good about this movie are some of the great cgi scenes other than that i think it is one of the absolute worst scifi movies i have ever seen so many bad things it would take me a year to write it all down it is a classic movie classic as being top 10 of the worse ever scifi made in the last 10 years how can this crap get such high reviews? it is very low budget bad acting bad everything has anyone ever seen star wars star trek? inception? or apocalypse now? if not watch one of these great movies then watch this total crap movie it should get a score of no more then a 4 at the most but the ruining of the actors makes me give it a 1 on top of all the illogical nonsense especially at the end he goes into a black hole? like his body could survive it? but lets just say he could then multi dimensions to where he turns a clock and then that saves humanity somehow? while crashing into a building somehow looking in a window then somehow they build a colony in space that of course he wakes up to a baseball game which is probably the only reason he agreed to do the movie to them rebuilding his old crappy house back home? i mean what the heck? makes no sense at all how did this movie hack the movie rating system?last year i made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch frozen in theaters because i thought it would be a great disney classic like tangled finally i can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as frozen thanks to my terrible experience with disneys frozen i read the entire plot for this movie before watching it thankfully i ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie like frozen was not worth paying to watch maleficent was basically a nonanimated nonmusical version of frozen apparently disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from frozen with different characters wonderful as expected the main point was a rehash of frozens true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman because it sells well after this movie i can officially say that disney has completely lost its magic we are now to believe that dream guys dont exist in fact all men are either extremely evil or just stupid what happened to the brave prince charming in classic disney stories? disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more realistic movies nowadays and by realistic i mean movies with strong independent females who are clearly superior to the men disneys recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of true love or dreams anymore i grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy prince charming but wait the people at disney had an epiphany having high expectations for guys is bad instead lets encourage little girls to dream of being bffs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her fathers worst enemys goddaughter instead im just thankful i dont have to grow up watching these lame disney movies i truly find disneys efforts in reversing its reputation of true loves kiss just pathetic hmm cynicism in fairy tales? just what we need as a classic disney lover count me out just a few comments 1 prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats 2 maleficent doesnt turn into a dragon yup you heard me whats the point of the movie then you ask? i have no idea also as you have probably already guessed theres no intense battle between prince phillip and maleficentasadragon either just splendid 3 why on earth is king stefan the villain? he was infatuated with maleficent and only married queen leila to take over the kingdom? what on earth has disney come to??? this movie is an insult to disneys sleeping beauty stefan>maleficent #teamstefanforlife 4 last but definitely not least whats up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? yes frozen im also looking at you this is by far my biggest issue with recent disney movies im sure walt disney is rolling in his grave actually since he was cremated perhaps i should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? either way you get the idea of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil none has ever been so inspirational to me as sleeping beauty  walt disney i hate to say it but disney is dead walt disney however will forever live on in our heartskingsman the secret service  the triumph of bad taste poor script poorly executed the action fake the play of many actors is weak colin firth is good but samuel jackson is ridiculous the music is just noise filthy language in every sentence it left an impression that the people in this movie dont know any language to express their needs or emotions absence of sense of class taste or style the first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring frustrated my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didnt allow them to relax when the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief production of such movies is a confusing message to the youth a terrible disappointmentkingsman is yet another comic book mess this time about a south london petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming its amusing to see a film be disrespectful about obama and agw but the film is morally repulsive and stupid it wants to be a silly but fun globetrotting adventure like old james bond films but those films had wit exotic travel high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude stuffed with fakelooking cgi charmless and has stupid jeopardyfree action scenes i lost count of just how many times the bad guys goons had the hero in their sights but missed him the promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs  apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman  with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit what really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass i could complain about the crudity of having a swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyperrealistic violence people are tortured and cut in half without a qualm worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a hate church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever if you want to see colin firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for youjust seen the film gone girl i really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so i thought id give it a go what a pile of crap two and a half hours of my life wasted the story is just unbelievable neither character makes you like them or hate them they are just bland and well unbelievable by the end i just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them i would have stood up and cheered as it happened it has a really lame ending a waste of my life utter tripejust saw the movie and wasnt a fan interesting premise but i felt some moments it tried to be funny tried to be over the top or even tried to be serious without being interesting it was if the movie was written for specific fight scenes and then pieced together in a rush recommend as a rental but even then it should be low on the list the others i went with had similar opinions with only the argument of which was worse this or jupiter ascending having only seen this one i am rating it a 4 because of the decent acting cool villain and good scorejust like the hobbit movies in which there is 0 real danger for the heroes guardians spends 98% of the time trying to convince you that the guardians are in danger there is no realism no heart to this movie the special ed character i am groot i find to be disturbingkinda like the guy in the ron burgundy movie is he there for laughs? is he there to show that the mentally disabled are just like normal people? conveniently there is no light in a scene so groot just grows pretty glowing light skin flakes from his arm you know for the adult children idiots who liked this film pretty colors tough girl sexy princess check animal character with bad attitude check egotistical smuggler check smugglers friend who turns on him check all powerful bad guy who is betrayed by the next worse bad guy check this movie is a complete rip off of star wars easy escape from detention area check incompetent prison guards check turning off power to escape check i just wanted to puke the action and dialogue belong in a childrens book why does the bad guy hate people? just cause? why does the bad guy suicide his ships instead of use them to shoot down the other planes? why does the bad guy throw people around instead of just killing them because this is a pathetic formula movie with no respect for real adultsjust hate nolan or nolanlovers should i say constant bombardment of science humbug correspondence to theory is not the point contrast it with the silence of 2001 contrast it with the film it tries to imitate now an average scifi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films without even a solid cinematic base except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise you sciencegeniuses all needed this information overload to accept a noteven average story as a cinematic masterpiece how i hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside battlefield earth or armageddon etc when the nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade awayjust dont watch it the movie has plot that has been in some muddle pud for a 3 hours star trek hologram episodes have more sense than this movie its an 3 hour cryfest no sense its not even visually goodugh i want my time back one of the worst movies ever definitely and anyone who says different is lying himself then you this movie has more holes than swiss cheese even prometheus has more logic than this not to mention those ghost whisperer scenes holy god that is so boring drama is expected every 5 minutesevery 5 minutes somebody cries there is 5 minutes of action everything else is just explosion noise and crying and crying and crying and crying just plain horrible mormons have more logic than this moviejust could not believe nolan would have created this junk i could hardly see any action sequence and all i get to see is a family melodrama in the name of a scifi movie the plot is good but the movie clearly missed the direction it needed well the concept of space travel gravity wormhole blackhole all looks good in books to know more about it i would have read the brief history of time again or watched more documents on the theory of relativity or blackholes but to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which was definitely missing in this movie if it was any other director i would have give it a 5 star but i have always looked upon nolan in the leagues of spielberg james cameron or guy ritchie so for all the great expectations and the disappointment all i could give is 1 star sorry nolan half the theater was empty by the time 1 hr flew and i had a take a short nap while the movie was running at a slow pacejust because this movies gimmick was that it was filmed over 12 consecutive years so you witness the kids growing up does not make this a fantastic movie the script was awful and went no where it was nothing but a series of boring unending vignettes strung together to try and tell a story which it failed to do the characters are onedimensional uninspiring bland and apathetic what child when given a birthday giftteenager or otherwisehas no reaction as if heshe is in a permanent braindead coma? how is that just like real life ? those raving about this movie are just those trying to jump on the bandwagon of the emperors new clothes well spoiler alert the emperor is naked they are saying it is just like real life i dont know anyone who acts like what was portrayed in real life no one outside of patricia arqettes one outburst reacts with any kind of emotion passion or pathos i have had more entertaining experiences getting patdowns from tsa at airport security dont waste your money dont waste your time if you want to see a movie about kids growing up filmed over several years watch the harry potter series at the very least you will be entertainedjust as with other of nolans flicks this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense how can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park? even the visuals weret that great just look at some hubble pics for petes sake the story line was weak unbelievable this movie made a mockery out of everything scientific it is scifi at its worst did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of twister? tars collected the data? like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data? i find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect i was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end this piece of bs is not worth the time and money close to 3 hours of my lifei will never get that back thanksjust another piece of hollywood trash if youre under the age of 8 or youre an adult male who reads comic books youll probably like this if youre a normal adult youll probably think its the stupidest movie youve ever seen it has all the depth and seriousness of kung fu panda the plot is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent snarky jokes and inane dialogue the plot climax in which the main character challenges the villain to a dance off practically screams at the audience ha ha ha you stupid idiots we already got your money seriously this movie doesnt even need joel tom servo and crow  it mocks itself this movie is really just beyond bad if youve ever wondered what it would be like if a faraway civilizations looked like bad nickelodeon shows or b a hollywood producer let his 12yearold son write a scifi screenplay youll find this intriguingive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull how?how can this movie has a rating above 8?? from the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess childish plot childish characters and awful awful humor all the times  even in the serious and important scenes theres always a stupid joke to ruin the momentwhich is already ruined but anyway countless clichs and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells the cgi where just ok and the fight scenes were at best indifferentthere were also some slomo scenes with nothing really to offeri mean its like a guy jumping in slow motionseriouslynothing cool about it nothing newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay awayive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull

newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay awayive got to admit that guardians of the galaxy caught me by surprise its rare that a movie turns out to be even worse than i imagined it might be you try to sit through movies like this like battlefield earth or buckaroo banzai or total recall the schwarzenegger version i still havent bothered with the reimagined remake or the fifth element or any one of a thousand others and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse my government knows no shame proclaims ronan in guardians of the galaxy nor apparently does his studio you know your movies in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon named rocky rocket who incidentally has the best line in the movie all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid to nothing at all pathetic thats called a nutshell review by the way this is just plain sloppy storytelling based on one of the leastinteresting comic books ever to see print and antman is next??? what are these people thinking? theres no rhyme or reason to anything theyre doing forget the lack of continuity this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves without the human elementive finally come to see this terrible movie and im still not done shaking my head in disappointment classic tale of pure good and pure evil plus saving the world plus wolf turned into sheep i mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love plus redemption through selfsacrifice plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease plus and all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus this is a spy flick even worse and lamer than james bond it is as far from being realistic as it gets virtually nothing that tomcruise does smells like reality watch it if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of the two good things about the movie are the stunts bravely done but absolutely unrealistic for the setting and the soundtrack that is quite decent for these two i give this movie a weak 3 it wasnt worth the timeits outrageously stupid i have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the kingsman and none of them hit the right mark the movie is violent raunchy campy sexist racist and vulgar and thats all ok but does it have to be so incredibly stupid? honestly does it? and why is the cgi so incredibly terrible last time i checked this is 2015 not 1985 i usually dont care too much for special effects but there is a given level of competence which i expect a film to achieve before it just becomes distracting kingsman has cgi on the level of a cheep syfy channel special feature the acting on the part of the star taron egerton is terrible every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face especially every time he opens his mouth same is true about samuel l jackson who played valentine that entire performance felt like samuel l jackson asked him self self how would snl pay this part if they were trying to make fun of me? then he used his fertile imaginations imagined it and played it exactly like that its samuel l jackson acting out a caricature of samuel l jackson playing the role of valentine i think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point truly a terrible movie not unlike the the league of extraordinary gentlemen only with uk hoodlum playing the main roleits not a science fiction movie  its  um i really dont know how to classify it other than its full of itself ive watched every science fiction showmovie out there and if youre like me you will be mad after watching this movie you can make a movie if your premise is right for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a chance at making a half decent science fiction movie you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible well winterstellar they dont even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence if you like star trekany of them tv spin offs or movies star wars babylon 5 battle star doctor whoold or new and even 2001 space odysseyboring but well made considering when it was made take my advice and stay away you will loose 3hrs of your life the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no senseits disgusting tom cruise turned a clever fun ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego i could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes cruise his movie i hold him responsible kills off his entire team which consists by and large of far more talented actors just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing this time its personal in those few minutes he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show its a disgrace ive never liked tom cruise but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the missionimpossible theme is a new low aside from this the movie itself is utterly formulaic uniting the implausible with the predictable jean reno is good in anything but no one can save thisits appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking acting an utterly fake working class character cynically shoehorned in to broaden the audience demographic an absurd lisp a pure clich_ english gentleman out of central casting and yet another phonedin performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure tortureits appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking acting an

performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure tortureits a shame that people are rating this movie so high i registered just to put some sense into imdb i actually dont believe in the ratings of this site anymore possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a scifi mindblowing movie even though that movie actually doesnt make sense i love nolan but he dropped the ball on this one this has potential but he created a mess out of it a lot of scientific inconsistencies useless characters messy plots one of the most overrated films ever lets bring back some credibility in this siteit would seem the impossible mission is to find as many ways as possible to degrade an original inspired seriesidea first lets get rid of the jim phelps character so that tom cruises ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess second lets forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene brian de palma directed this ? the originalimf force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible jim phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys this movie will do nothing for de palmas reputation the final result is a disappointment  more so because in places the movie does get it right and it becomes evident what could have been and should have beenit was awful absolutely pointless without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks also doesnt work we can clearly see everything comes from market last year gravity made and worked and matthew mcconaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit or to just save the humanity  its very funny and this film received high points because it cant even entertain you i think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this dont waste your time and dont engage in fake worldit starts off with a farmer independence day style and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because well were not really sure why but it involves a lot of wind then nasa gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of space that comes complete with bad paintings of old hubble pictures lots of space type language and gravity the gravity is ever present nothing ever floats about and they get skipped off the orbit around mars before whizzing past saturn it has rings and arriving at a black hole they get through the black hole like thats possible by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys the robots look and act like corn flake boxes the humans mostly well known look bemused and at that point i had to stop watching i was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke but it wasnt i dont like ranting so i wont suffice to say that if the earth has to end at least let it explode before hollywood can make another turkey like this embarrassingly badit started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence ill give it that then it started getting extremely graphic mass murders heads exploding our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldnt even talk all the way home we all wish we could unsee it i felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts this movie taught me a lesson i will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review i can get my hands on this isnt the first time i have been blind sighted by gore and disturbing content if you see this movie i beg you not to take your kids even if they are adults i wish i could go back and not have gone to this one frankly i am disappointed that movie makers feel americans have sunk so low as to find this entertainingit should come as no surprise that a mindtrip experience would begin in berkeley californiaã and with a mellow jorma kaukonen acoustic track chiming from a record player into a lovely

us absolutely nowhereit is very difficult to describe how angry i felt after sitting through nearly 2 hours i felt like some smug a**hole who thinks hes smarter than everyone just kicks me in the head spits in my eyes and then call me names i have never felt so insulted by a film but then again i had never bother to watch the star wars prequels the plot is full of holes and the twists and turns are hardly plausible it is true that here are instances good acting can be a saving grace for a bad movie but there is precious little of that in the film the lead characters are unconvincing and tedious bores ben affleck well hes ben affleck sometimes he does decent work but only sometimes the biggest disappointment is rosamund pike i know she is no maryl streep but she is usually not this bad first of all her american accent she talks like she is in some black and white movies from the 50s fine so may be she is channeling some heroine from a hitchcock film but who talks like that anymore okay i am being a nitpicky here my bad her character was supposed to be highly complicated but there was no depth she couldnt even do a halfway decent mimicry of a damaged person its down right pathetic all the supporting characters are awful all except kim dickens she is the saving grace of the film if there is one its wonderful to watch her as the lead investigator of the case of missing wife and the only thing that keeps the movie from flying away like a kite in a wind storm she held on as long as she could all the way until near the end when david fincher ran out of time alas she cannot save this hot stinking pile of garbage somebody please give ms dickens a better position in her career she deserves it the worst one is probably neil patrick harris what happened there doogie? i cannot talk about what is wrong with his character without going into a tirade and spill too much beans so i will stop there doogie stay with comedy please i am glad that not everyone is fooled by this american beautyesque bull doo doo frankly i did not go in with too high an expectation i saw the high rating on imdb but i also heard grumbles that it was not that great the bar i set was in the middle and i still gets crushingly disappointed that is how bad this movie isit is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of the original movie achieved a total failure the weakness of this film if compared to the previous sequels it would simply appear as a clich disney pictures will rely on heavy advertising in order to attract the audience to see it if you are looking for creativity and an interesting movie this film will not cheer you up if you have much money and you got much free time to waste then all you have to do is see this awful movieit is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of

to do is see this awful movieit is so disappointing to see a real classic destroyed by the same people that own the right to preserve it sleeping beauty 1959 stands among all disney films because of its great characters incredible art all the landscapes drawn by eyvind earle are legendary and because disney wisely used tchaikovskys ballet score well maleficent has no personality at all i must admit that jolie fits the role perfectly but sadly her character is so bad developed that it hurts king stefan is such an idiot with no depth at all and that also hurts because in the 1959 film he is a good king fanning does not give any charm to aurora the public does not fall in love with her regarding the art direction well at the beginning the film is a kind of dark crystaltinkerbell movie then it turns into lord of the rings it would have been great that this film would have an original art direction to honor the animated film the story is so rushed aurora sleeps like 15 minutes and the she wakes up to help maleficent kill his father and she gets real happy afterwards it is a shame reallyit is incomprehensible to me that i watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on imdb seemed to perhaps i was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole wormhole or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid all i know is that my hardearned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that i am truly regretful like a few other commenters i had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors a ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases very little of this movie makes any sense at all it amazes me that nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel i should note that on several occasions i actually couldnt help but laugh out loud at the absurdity and that fact was truly telling for me mr nolan et al  you owe me two hours and fortynine minutes of my life backit is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be brainy intelligent well written with all the things i read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment ive experienced from cinema in years i give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating in reality this movie is of course not that bad the whole idea behind the plot is that mcconaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity so what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events mcconaughey ended up inside this blackhole all this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along was there really no easier way for future humansaliens to transmit this data and if they built this timespace warping machine inside the blackhole  means they had access to the data all along? and also means they chose mcconaughey daughter on purpose? so i dont understand what was this purpose? could they not have connected their portal to professors office a long time ago or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? on a side note is it not funny how mcconaughey ignored the message not to go from the same ghost yet followed the rest of the directions? while in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt had he added its you dad or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this and i dont even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch which was unaffected after being picked up meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? what was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then if he could do that he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out and anyway they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her? why couldnt they have done the same thing on earth? just build the same goddamn station on earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t bam humanity saved in the same way grand ideas dont make great movies if you cant deliver them properly it is atrocity to compare this to kubricks masterpieceis it just me or this series is just going down the drain every character is getting awfully whiny as each episode is completed if it goes at the same rate this show will probably take the honours of he whiniest show out there when the show started off i thought it was just laurel but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested but then there was thea even that was agreeable to a certain extent as shes a confused just out of teens kid but then somehow the lead character oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do  wthinterstellar was yet another over hyped hollywoodized movie 1010 visuals and an ost that sucks you in but the rest was pseudo intellectual bullshit designed to seem deep if youre on drugs or unversed in the sciences of what it actually talks about those with knowledge in string theory other dimensions or who have an intelligence even slightly above average who dont get trapped by hollywood and consumerism would likely agree it sucks i can in all ernest rate that movie a 310 with only the last 20 minutes of that 3 hour movie being evenly slightly worth watching it would get a 110 if the visuals werent incredible and the acting decent the supposed relationships between characters were awful it was slow paced while simultaneously rushing the only 20 minutes that were slightly interesting despite being pseudo intellectual and was all way to predictable minus the attempt to be deep in the last 20 minutes by trying to connect a 5th dimension to the story line and his daughters ghost in her room which was foreseeable the first second he saw her through the bookshelf weirdness that was a waste of time i want my 15$ backinterstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage 2014 as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space it let me so down instead of a true vision for the future interstellar works out an ordinary hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship sorry christopher nolan but this is not what i payed for why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? the unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless austronauts dont go into space without a strict course so not in interstellar in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take this is supposed to be science? dont make laugh what a drivelinterstellar one of the worse films ive seen in a long time 170mins of self indulgent rubbish slow and tedious does not even begin to describe this $160 million piece of nonsense the horrible church organ hans zimmerman music score often drowns out the dialogue so badly that the sound mix must have been done by helen keller terrible special effects that look like they come from a movie made in the 70s a shameless ripoff from 2001 gravity dark star contact to mention just a few awful wideeyed hammy performances from all concerned a terrible nonsensical script with enormous plot holes and hilariously bad science christopher nolan should never be allowed to make another film again i deeply regret those 170 minutes that this monstrosity has taken out of my life unfortunately theres no wormhole that can take me back before i made the unfortunate decision to see this filminterstellar is christopher nolans big bigbudget homage to kubricks 2001 except it is not where 2001 robert zemeckis contact which also cast matthew mcconaughey and alfonso cuarÜns gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there the premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate earths population after earths environmental collapse is a fatal flaw black holes radiate powerful deadly radiation and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black holes crushing gravity somehow the hero cooper gets himself inside the black hole unharmed where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life and somehow he sends his past self a message the illogic of that circular logic ignores first cause breaks the entire arc of the storyline such as it is then there are illogical subplots like the crew rescues an abandoned astronaut dr mann from death and he repays them by trying to kill all of them for no expressed reason the fight scene between dr mann matt damon and cooper mcconaughey is intercut with something happening back on earth setting fire to a cornfield that doesnt have any apparent connection the sound balance raises sappy music designed to portray emotions like heroism way above the volume of the actors voices the audience cant hear much of what they are saying i thought at first this was a flaw because i assumed that what they were saying would clarify some of the meaningless actions but now i believe that it was just as it was supposed to be gibberish although nolan spent many many millions and some reviewers think this movie rates their highest number of stars i say it is close but not quite the worst movie of all time giving it the title of worst would confer too much attention to this sorry wasteinterstellar is a terrible movie three things one the movie is too long two the beginning is boring three it is stupidi never saw a movie this boring before i dont recommend this movie to anyone it does not get interesting till the very end of the movie if you want to see a good movie this is not the movie for you to watch interstellar got so many people wanting to watch it including myself and it was terrible dont watch this movie it is not good i would rather put a stick in my eye then watch this movie again it is boring i never saw a movie that was this badinsipid tepid vacuous the first 30 minutes are the most pretentious script ever written in the history of film making please somebody burn every copy of this film ever distributed to try to sit through this film to its uninspired and tired read lame ending challenges the endurance okay lets start with the actors ben affleck has not made a good movie ie a movie a viewer might be able to sit through since jay & silent bob strike back who forcedcorralled rosamund pike into making this?? who willingly makes movies with affleck besides jennifer lopez?? really? i was sitting on the couch with my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to hit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time during the first thirty minutes god help america hollywood acting and moviemakinginception had some problems but its concept stretched the imagination christopher nolans new film delivers exactly what a pessimist would expect if a puffedup batman director thought he could eclipse kubricks 2001 with a puerile adventure story interstellar begins badly and goes steadily downhill as its longwinded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a steven spielbergnorman rockwell scifi coproduction  a dying earth a widowed exastronaut farmer his chiseled jaw a feisty daughter a crusty grandpa paranormal activity dust storms baseball cornfields  and lots of corn after about an hour  which seems like two  a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity once theyve journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic heights of absurdity scientific hocuspocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis deranged astronauts spaceship chases time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy hallmarklevel climax the visual effects are above average but far short of awesome when all is said and done the films ludicrous selfimportance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanitys extinctionin this movie theres cgi in every shot even cinderellas shoes are but cgi hard to believe yet true i can barely watch so much visual boredom lacking real props in the acting i cant see fairy tale type of acting too i would have expected to see the acting being at least as intensive as in the wizard of oz or cinderfella the actors mimics are close to nothing i dont comprehend on why press reports are reporting cate blanchetts performance as overacting gee if anything else than a botoxed face is already declared as overacting these guys should definitively stop gazing at mannequins im a huge fan of kenneth branagh from his shakespeare movies but this time he set the bar too lowin the opening night i walked out from the movie theater totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance poorly developing plot immature explanation of astrophysics unbelievable and unrelated events and characters especial effects leveled to a disney comedy and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression even mathew mcconaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter older than himself mat damon probably did his careers worst acting the robot was another annoying part what did anne hathaway and two other guys add to the story? using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an intergalaxy spaceship??? finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole in another galaxy seemed easier than finding an atm machine in a us interstate highway why would a director hire a blackholeworldexpert as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? just reading the worm hole article in wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge mr nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message awareness of climate changes saving human species teaching relativity theory to common movie goers or the power of love each of them bold and superficialimdb 82 rating? seriously? this is basically the worst movie i ever seen i am still very sorry for my 3hourinlife has been wasted a week has been passed and i am still very sorry so i decided to write my very first review here to tell people how bad this movie is if i wanna watch a movie i wanna watch movie with plots with happenings with characters development but not a reallifelike  boring pointless film if i wanna watch a reallife something i rather watch a penguin grow old in 12 years with its family and i am sure it will be more interesting than watching boyhood the boy before aged 8 still adorable but once he is in high school he became a puppet with no facial expression and act like nothing worth him for a laugh this movie is long like i have been spending 12 years in the cinema its like forever i literally clapped when its end as i am too excited and over the moon that the movie is finally over boyhood definitely deserved a best picture best picture to sleep on best picture that deserved the worst picture ever best picture to make you feel regret for your 3hoursin life best picture to exchange puzzled eyes with your friends during the whole movieim very disappointed the script the direction the stiff acting by rebecca hall paul bettany and kate mara ive also seen enough of morgan freeman to last two life times please stop already i wish i had my two hours of watch time back so i wouldnt feel so cheated and used poor johnny depp ive seen this movie in one form or the other from years ago junk it up with cgi computer magic doesnt make the script any better maybe the players would be a bit more believable if i wasnt able to say their lines as they were said on the screen the bad guys wereeveryone in my bookim not a fan of comic book heroes and wasnt even familiar with the character before i noticed the pilot listed on tv im down to only two hours of television per week i cant handle any more than that and thought it might be nice to see something new and it would be nice  if there ever was anything new i made myself sit through the whole pilot which by todays standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials long before it was over i found myself asking a familiar question does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality remember when the commercials during the superbowl were all funny? maybe some of you arent that old but believe me its true they used to be funny why arent all commercials funny? does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? i wonder tv shows used to be creative technical artistic and dramatic a few of them still are ok maybe two of them still are the rest are crap does it cost less to produce crap? i have to admit that my expectations of any new show arent very high but arrow like so many other shows today fall so far short its laughable lets not talk about the oh come on situations like how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years how does the heros friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guys office? and how do people who cant act cant write and cant direct get jobs in tv anyways? is the golden age of television really gone?im going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show that i have ever reviewed and i have watched a lot of them boyhood seemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting enough to give it a shot but what really made me go to see it were all of these reviews calling it a masterpiece this may have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen if sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2 hours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then i highly recommend this film i honestly have no idea how someone could even call this a good movie let alone a masterpiece or a once and a lifetime experience im legitimately angry that i watched this movieim always excited to see movies that arent what most people consider your average already done hollywood blockbuster but this was so awful i had to write just how much i disagree with all the praise this movie has gotten the idea of filming a boys transition to manhood over 12 years of actual time sounds like a fantastic idea but im afraid that is really all this movie has going for it we follow the main character through his childhood and teenage years i dont know about you but at least for me those were the most exciting and sometimes heartbreaking times of my life i cant really say why the director didnt want to show any of masons truly pivotal moments or his true emotions he just shows us the truly mundane moments and expects us to be amazed at his originality sorry i wasnt in fact i was quite bored mason mostly sleep walks through the whole movie no real emotion about anything happening in his life sure he cracks a smile now and again nothing like the true rollercoaster that is life the other people in masons life are about uninteresting and one dimensional as he is this movie is a one trick pony that doesnt even do that one trick well critics have praised this to the hilt which convinced me to see it i sometimes disagree with critics but have never felt as opposed to them as i do about this film if you can sit through this absolute snooze fest twice you really should get out moreim a huge fan of the original mission impossible television series on which this was based when it was announced that a movie version would be made i naively got very excited with anticipation of seeing it i read every scrap of information published about the movie before its release however when i saw it i was very disappointed this wasnt mission impossible at all but a tom cruise action vehicle i never bothered to see any of sequels its too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that this is mission impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series it doesnt surprise me that greg morris walked out in the middle of this film and said its an abomination because tom cruise has tainted mis image so badly no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of mi at least not during mr cruises lifetime or mine thanks a lot tomill try to be as objective as possible here but unlike the premise of this film you wont be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours first im not a scifi fan but rather was a nolan fan so i did want to give this film a chance i dont claim to be a film expert by any stretch but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with the thin red line 1998 in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance further the visuals in this film were extremely boring its outer space throw in something to look at even if outside of textbook physics with the exception of the black holes its literally black the entire time or a saturn backdrop they also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects or lack thereof so earth is dying but they really never get into the whys and hows in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission which only exemplifies my point unless einstein himself wrote this script the dialogue in this film is meant to be so overthetop that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it nor question it i had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion at no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hulahoop good actors cant make up for their own lack of character development sure cooper cries when leaving his daughter but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away i think what bothered me most and fits the theme for lack of visual effort were the stupid robots they are basically chrome atm machines with block appendages if i was going to cram a bunch of people and adequate supplies into a spaceship i wouldnt design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit pure visual lazinessr2d2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago the more i write and think about this movie the more im reminded of how awful it was this to me was hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goers time and moneyill start this with the good points angelina jolie does an absolutely amazing job as the dark fairy maleficent the various acting jobs range from acceptable the three fairies to quite impressive maleficent and aurora in particular also the effects and design are simply gorgeous the magical effects and creatures are wonderful and just look great now the bad i had really hoped disney was above the trend of gritty rebootsremakes but i have been sorely disappointed the draw of maleficent in the classic sleeping beauty was how incredible a villain she was she was just plain evil by turning her into a character who is not only sympathetic but eventually heroic this movie does a great disservice to the character who invoked all the powers of hell to ensure her victory maleficent watches over the young aurora keeping her safe while the three bumbling fairies maintain *complete* uselessness for the sake of comic relief eventually after she and aurora meet face to face maleficent begins to lament her death curse even trying and failing to undo it by the end of the film one is supposed to be rooting for maleficent because the kingdom of humans is corrupt greedy and evil the king completely insane i cannot imagine what executive thought this would be a good idea but it falls prey to gritty reboot syndrome resulting in something that feels more like character named after the ones in that other movie instead of a different interpretation i dont quite mean to say that the movie should have been exactly like sleeping beauty but it just shows no respect for the classic in the first place dont waste your timeill start by saying upfront i was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie being a primarily marvel comic book reader and tv showcartoon viewer since the mid70s im dont care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book so yes i started watching with a bias but three successive clichs in the first 15 minutes were immediate strike outs for me 01 the dancing to soundtrack while you work scene 02 perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03 the hey thats my property youre impounding give it back scene never mind the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an cgi space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a cgi walking talking catchphrase spewing tree or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack etcyawn i think you get the point imo the best comic book movie thus far is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cgiill start by saying upfront i was only able

is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cgiill start 1 12 years of wasted time 2 literally nothing happens for 3 hours 3 scumbag stepfathers everywhere 4 the transition from cute kid to an emo kid 5 i only write this cuz imdb requires 10 lines of text 6 12 years of indie rock bands 7 not sure if gay 8 most epic twist in movie history lol jk 9 cant believe its nominated for an oscar 10 best movie to sleep on 11 how to throw away $4000000 12 the boring life of a regular kid 13 unfortunately it didnt get more hd each 20 minutes 14 desperate housewife 15 much feels wow 16 this is why you shouldnt trust imdb ratings 17 shot in 12 years lasts 12 years alsoif you like fairy tales and believe in love then youll hate this film its beautifully filmed and well acted by angelina jolie but the story is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous by the end of the film i just started laughing at how insane it was made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have suffered the worst break up in history or else she just really hated men i was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in theaters now i wish i had my money back some may say this film is like frozen thats only if we discovered christoff was actually in league with the evil prince and olaf was their spyif you have technology to build spaceships that go through black holes and technology to make ai machines and robots that look like the monolith from kubriks space odyssey then you dont have to leave earth or any space body since you wouldnt need to any more you just remake the world as you see fit you can stop storms change the weather anyway you like it and grow any kind of food without even planting it you just synthesize all the minerals you need and give them any taste that you would like so the whole idea of this movie is ridiculous and the story itself is so full of plot wholes and just as inception it doesnt make any sense i mean come on some fake scientists writing some fake formulas to solve some fake theorems using some fake scientific methods are you serious? what is this bs???  to tell the truth this movie is nothing but a communist propaganda on a large scale to fool people into believing that life is really way too complicated to make it good for all people are made to think that living in compact spaces in tight spaces in an environment of deprivation is something that is ok and should be taken by people as something normal to fool people into thinking that if they are not going to shrink their living space then they have no chance of surviving they fool people to think that we need to give up life and become just button pressers sitting in small boxes high on fantasy they already have us sitting in our flatsapartments connected to the internet and they feed us a ton of bs every day all day all year and as you see since we have moved in into the cities the bs is getting stronger and stronger with each year and the tighter we are compacted into the cities the level of bs is so high that it just stops making any sense whatsoever have you noticed that all stories now at least the mainstream stories do not make any sense?? everything is so soaked in propaganda that the reality itself is getting destroyed by that propaganda you people should think about it all you who live in small flats and have no life you think about it next time you discuss how great all these movies are you think about how some bs fantasy drama bs moved you how emotional was the experience you think about it and then go back to your tight living space you know what? i dont think you get it the ironyif you ever saw kubricks 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie if you did notthen rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap interstellar is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement inception was the same thing but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence  do not be fooled by the concept there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive the whole things must make sense in nolans depressing mind the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse the movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects in fact this is a movie about god but nolans refuse to even refer about religion so the movie is about something that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense ***spoiler ahead*** without saying too much about the first ending there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd  why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ? ***end of spoiler*** mcconaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible anne hathaway is always good but his character is under written jessica chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations and she does not succeed in brief do not commit the same error i made save your money for a better and more sincere money this one is just a scamif you can look past the horrid acting the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters  this series is for you but then again if you watch something based on the leads sixpack somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series personally i prefer stories of substance a tale with progress characters and a protagonist that has more going for himher than just a pretty face orand chiseled abs it is hard to believe that arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season its sad to see quality writing ie smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent humanif you are a big fan of the television series starring peter graves and martin landau like i am then you will hate this movie as much as i did it has nothing to do with the television series other than its title and opening musical sequence i went in to this movie expecting more if you can get beyond these prejudices then you can expect at best a mediocre movie right off the top of my head i can pick five or six episodes from the series that were actually better than this movie its a shame because i like tom cruse hes better than thisif this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then after 50 years of cinemagoing im opting out for good are the filmmakers of the 21st century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? so a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteurs the writerdirector a dude from the past 1988 gets taken into space subhitchhiker galaxystyle and gets to spout substar wars dialogue in a subspaceballs kinda plot i was looking at my watch after the first half hour there was no irony or intelligence in the story the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sourfaced flatchested star trek reboot and they both survive the director could have at least looked at total recall if the physics were too tough for him if they can censor the best part of zulu for alleged raaacism then i truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism a sequel is naturally in the works god bless you stanley kubrickif this had been written and played as a straightout dark comedy  and if it had been at least half an hour shorter  perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie but since it has been presented as a serious mystery it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking  that of disrespecting the intelligence andor perspicacity of the audience for us the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen  and weve seen many this was even worse than babel that said  and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory  the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot so ladies and gentlemen start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity 1 amy buys a car listed on craigslist for cash so theres no record of the purchase how about title and license? where does she keep the car until she needs it? how does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2 amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sisterinlaws shed with them how does she get into and out of the shed without her sisterinlaw who doesnt like her noticing? 3 the shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman they dont notice the accumulating gadgets? 4 the gadgets are bought online who is signing for them? 5 when the gadgets are investigated whose fingerprints will be all over them  if there are any? 6 desi is supposed to have broken into the house beat her bloody and kidnapped her theres blood all over the kitchen but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7 as he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious amy desi picks up her diary takes it to her fatherinlaws place and attempts to burn it in the furnace why? 8 how does desi know where amys fatherinlaw lives? 9 several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until amy winds up at desis lake house can nobody attest to desis being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping amy? 10 what will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11 desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner did nobody at the casino notice them there  including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12 where does amys car wind up? 13 phone records i amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed no record of that? 14 amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy  which causes her money belt to fall off this apparently was an acme money belt on loan from wile e coyote 15 a couple robs amy of all her money being the psycho she is are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16 phone records ii what is going to be made of amys phone call to desi? sure it was from a pay phone but isnt it going to raise any flags? 17 amy selfinflicts wounds  supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras  to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped yet wouldnt the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18 amy winds up in the hospital upon her return they put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her  but they dont bother to wash the blood off of her 19 do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20 nick knows that amy tried to set him up for her murder thus opening him up to a possible death sentence he also knows that when her plan blows up she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her other than being male in order to cover up her actions which until that point may have been criminal  but not capital  offenses why does nick elect to live in the same county as this woman let alone in the same house? i could go on but i realized before the movie was halfway over that i had already wasted too much of my life on itif they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45minit would be worth two starsbut they didnt as most hollywood movies with overpaid people who cant actthey stretch it way beyond way beyond what they got storyline i havent read the bookand after watching the movie i dont want to either rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning bitchbt could just as easy be replaced and affleck does whatever its he doeslook stupid i call itbut others referred to it as acting theres so many plot holes that i wouldnt know where to begin start with all the stuff he supposedly boughtmost stores have security cam these days should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing the items or notif no one has any objections to the church scene i wonder how they would have reacted when it would rather be a mosque or the greenpeace headquarters this movie shows the exact same thing valentines device did how it could use good music to make you laugh at the most horrible things and think literally it is ok in a way this movie places valentines device right in the theater and shows us our true reactions to horror dished up in the right atmosphere totally acceptable i wonder how we would react because we are aware of the moral wrongness if this music was played and well choreographed in a nazi concentration camp congratulations if you liked the church scene and the scene where the world leaders lost their heads you just experienced the numbing effect the nazi soldiers have felt as they led people to be incinerated full of the music of the f»hreri would normally not comment on a film that i didnt like because it would be universally panned but when i saw how high the ratings are on imdb i was astonished are there that many people who actually do not believe that men went to the moon or that somehow education for the masses is a bad thing? are there people who think that somehow having more farmers means more food production? if the food supply were to be tittering on depletion it would most likely be because education and scientific research had been discouraged long before there was any food crisis this film begins with the absurd and then proceeds to the unbelievable that down home farmer with the rebellious daughter just happens to be the long lost astronaut who is going to save the world its here that the movie switches from social criticism to fairy tale it is just so disheartening that a film so full of misconceptions and false premises appeals to so many peoplei wish i have better things to say about this show unfortunately i have none i wont complain too much about the execution of the badly written scripts i have seen them before and i can stomach that to an extent what made me throw cold water on it is its bad acting stephen amell has the most inexpressive face among the guys ive seen playing the lead role the girls who are mostly present for ornamental reasons thanks to the writers also manage to actively support amell in his able job it left me with a feel of watching a bgrade material they had a promising start with the narrative going back and forth between the time when ollie was marooned and arrow fighting injustice in star city i guess thats all there is to it till the end or up until i watched it the plot didnt spend time in developing any of the other characters the lines were not bad but none of them will ever stick with you if one is looking for action entertaining plot or pretty faces it would pass all sent to be chopped to pieces so some brass could get his medal some politician could get elected and so on thats a strong metaphor for a film and thats why i respect tmc as a honest work of art fc lacks any of that artistic integrity this is just pure crass commercialismi will usually watch any film with johnny depp in it but i wish that i had made this the exception to my rule somehow as soon as this film began i knew i was in trouble call it an intuitive sense based on the number of films ive watched or whatever but the truth is i was correct it is a tremendous waste of exceptional talent in a film that is way beyond preposterous i can deal with expanding what is believable but this film presents it in a way that is incredibly not interesting i found myself not caring within 30 minutes actually to make a scifi film so lacking takes a certain kind of talent its a shame because the genre is screaming for intelligent wellmade movies its also a cruel joke to fill it with so much top talent and then waste it with so poor a script johnny depp could not look more bored and one of his over the top performances might have helped herei will preface this by saying that i have not read the books i did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it i usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasnt bad this movie however was terrible heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow ive heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book if thats the case i cant speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a highschooler at best the movie is riddled with clich_s main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made boring people and armies showing up just at the perfect time forgivable once not around the 5th time bad guys who couldnt hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon man those guys suck and the ultimate faked death with poisonparalysis scene wow that whole scene was bad throughout the whole movie the main character the annoying tomboy girl tris keeps being painted as tough and deadly she is neither of these in fact she is quite laughably the opposite could her personal trainers not put her through some weighttraining classes? her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her own hair with a pair of rusty scissors it looks like she couldnt even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease but she looks like a huge wuss her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing action made me bust out laughing and the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be badass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back man i wanted to laugh so bad and probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how pointless everything was examples they fight the factionless on the train killing several and doing serious damage to many more not really sure how because tris fights like a sissy girl then the main character four says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like oh we cool bro never mind you just headbutted me in the face and killed my friends the hell?? oh and triss brother is a huge pussy they continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly uniformed drone guards of the capital so that they can go in to hiding then the main character just gives herself up i think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices never seen that before but it doesnt really matter then shes given the chance to escape by her double double crossing friend didnt see that coming and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway?? i was dying to contain my frustration also how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergentboxopening proprietary chamber system complete with bulletproof glass and mysterybox holding pedestal just already set up? does no one question this stuff??? and to top it all off the supersecret mustbepreservedatall costs message in the box the entire point of the movie divergents are cool dont ostracize them oh and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall cheers what? no one has bothered to check this whole time?????? gag enough roasting to conclude lots of movies even good ones have clich_s and information that you are just supposed to assume but this movie was genuinely terrible maybe all the people reviewing this with an 710+ saw a different movie than i didi will give this movie a 1 for visual effects only 1 because the director put the emphasis on these but stole ideas from avatar and man of steel  the flight looks cool doesnt it? other than that the movie is sending confusing messages to the ignorant people of our times who dont know that maleficent means one who does evil so  in anyones opinion  how can an entity that looks like a devil fairies dont have devilish horns and dark colored wings with ugly horns on them and is called one who does evil named from birth not after she suffers the deception how can such a person be presented as kind? honestly?? its something new from disney  to have a voiceover say in such a gentle voice hello dear stupid audience  heres our dear devil that we want you to love she looks ugly but try to love her love her horns love her ugliness love her evil name love her companion whos also named like a devil this is the new kind of love that were telling you its the real thing its in tune with the youths love for vampires werewolves and ghost stories that so many have fallen in nowadaysi went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent scifi movie but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap here are the few reasons why i found it crap 1 if a guy fell in a typhoon a usual earth disaster it is most probable he will die but mr coop is made of some different material the guy went inside a black hole where matter collapse beyond nuclear and quark level but he comes out in one piece with all his consciousness intact this very presentation by nolan just cheapened the depiction of a black hole 2 so top notch team was sent out by nasa yet they cry and whine about so small issues like oh i want to see my daughter back even at my company of 16 people we act more professionally seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of nolani went to this movie expecting an incredible masterpiece as advertised on a saturday afternoon there were about 25 people there i was so very disappointed this movie went on and on and on so much so that i continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end would it ever end?? and then it kept going while the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever the film just needs major editing its the story of a boy growing up there was abuse which was painful to watch but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring it goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts it is just slow long and boring i seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back i wasnt sure if everyone was in the same pain i was but i also considered standing up and yelling when will this film ever end?i went to this film and all i can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen im having a hard time writing about this film because i honestly wish i could forget about the film the film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound the negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review the film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see matthew mcconaughey do some wonderful acting however none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them however the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake the movie is full of quantum physics jargon that no one could possibly follow the jargon is about an hour of the movie and i have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but i can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didnt make any sense im not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film it felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid tripi went to see this last night with my wife in a screening and we both thought it was total tripe it was a brainless movie with terrible acting story and script even the special effects were done badly the story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent the violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable  i normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive there was also sadly the usual braindead racial stereotyping propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable i have never seen acting as bad as samuel l jacksons acting in this movie and i also have no idea why people like michael caine agreed to be in this rubbish this film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most uk cinemas its sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people  there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support this is seriously one to avoidi went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings i love scifi i would have like to travel to other planets not anymore i wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it first i said to people that interstellar was only for scifi freaks that it was not a feel good movie pretty damn dark and depressing but it was overall a good movie but my love of scifi had block all judgment after talking to other people who saw it my view of the film change radically here are why  1 have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar 2 the pilot farmer daughter saw gps coordinates in dust yeah right and they goes to those coordinates and find nasa bunker they are abducted by the nasa and the nasa chiefs tells the farmer  you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity even tough the nasa didnt sent the dusty coordinates wtf 3 the extra beinggodor human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole near saturn why so far? 4 they went to a sea planet to rescuesee those sent before that is a sea planet with no ground to plant foodanimals not a good choice and they couldnt see the giant waves from space? 5 they went to a ice planet to rescuesee those sent beforeice planet without animalsplantswhats the point so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6 the spaceship is relatively small we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity inside the ship there is the machine to create babies 10010000 ? fertilized human eggswithout ? the incubators if you find a planet yes to the babies but the spaceship so small that the foodbaby milk would be out quite soon 7 have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? a kind of trash bag that wrap you up 8 nobodys really knows whats inside a black hole but nolans view is ridiculous add that the the farmer go out of it and survive to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceshipi went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had but its not like i was over expecting or anything in the end i found this thing a total a mess i think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects it tried to take itself serious as a spy movie yet it also tried to be this weird comedy and while i think movies are capable of doing both this one just didnt do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely far as it taking itself seriously i found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid far as the comedy i just didnt think the nuclear head explosions or the mcdonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all granted im american and i get that english humor is a bit different but i love monty python snatch mr bean even most of the bond films yet most of the funny moments in this movie i just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie and the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie now on the taking itself seriously aspect the whole spy gig the young recruit it just failed on that level for me as well certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good but i thought the editing needed a lot of work the massacre in the church i just thought was way over done and too long i find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when its all done people are barely winded breathing normally give me a break go watch professional boxers or mma fighters and see how they look after just one round and they are real athletes who train vigorously so while some of the action was okay it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie so between the bad comedy and overcooked action i was constantly being reminded that i was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one my last beef is with the main kid and the whole recruitment  training camp probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid whos training to this point has been gymnastics so okay hes flexible has good balance etc yet with little to no further training at all hes the biggest bad ass? the recruitment  initiation program was a joke it wasnt a training program of any kind it was basically lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top i get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one but the whole while i kept thinking so this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues? then once hes out and starts real life spy work hes untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins its like her moms bf who bullies him early in the movie who he confronts in the end and im thinking so other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter? overall i thought the action was decent but very over the edge of what youd consider to be believable movie believability i mean the black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd i give it a 3  10 one point on principle and because i liked the main spy girl a 2nd point because some of the action was decent and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end which shocked me enough to yell out helloi went into this movie thinking it would be a nice movie from disney since i had heard it was a darker adaptation from the classic sleeping beauty from the perspective of the villain and i still think its a great idea and still expect to see the same thing with other classics even if in this case the idea was very poorly executed starting with the director it was a risky bet by disney because robert stromberg had never directed a movie his work is almost exclusively visual effects and it didnt pay off even though he did a good job adapting from the original story there were some parts where the story and some actions from the characters didnt make sense at all then the acting was also sad bad acting from the three fairies lesley manville imelda staunton juno temple and from all the male characters especially sharlto copley angelina jolie did a good job not her best of course but a solid acting the idea of maleficient was to tell the story of sleeping beauty from the perspective of maleficient but it didnt even give depth to the character there are holes on the story and that hurts it pretty bad the images and effects were also very average and not good enough for 2014 overall the movie wasnt appealing at all and the story acting and effects were weak however i applaud the idea and hope disney learns from this movies mistakes and do more of these kind of movies but much betteri went in with low expectations but nothing can prepare you for such a dreadfully uninspiring convoluted ass numbing experience matthew mcconaughey is totally miscasthardly audible at timesterrible southern droll there is so much crying in this film he cries his daughter cries the scientist cries the insert villain cries this film treats dangerous black holes like an elevator journeytheir dangerous magnitude and awe is lost and ignored in a few short scenes the colour pallet for this film is washed out greys dull and lifeless the 2 planets they visit are so badly realised and uninteresting you can hear several astronomers and physicists weeping in their homes and hanging up their lab coats christopher nolan is on a mission to devolve the human race with total nonsense its just awful another space film ruined by a weird crazy space odyssey endingto be honest the film lost me long before that the robot is terriblelike something clunked together from lego by a 4 year old every scene with it in made the audience cringe or laugh 165 million dollar film with some of the worst effects ive seen on the big screen in years the camera angles were baffling especially following the shuttles in and out of orbit they were filmed so closeit was like the director knew they were st and said its ok guysill pan to a member of the crew crying i didnt care about any of the charactersnolan is just awful at conveying human relationships awful script writer with his brothernepotism at its finest im still recoveringshockedim done with nolanthe dark knight rises was awful inception was awfulthis is just the icing on the cakethis should have been a space exploration film wowing the hard paying audience with its gripping story and dazzling effectsin the end its just total toshlifeless boring and self indulgenti watched this painfully boring movie to the end  all 2+ hours of it everything in the film rang false i am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying i hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again parental guilt love duty heroism blah blah blah this movie does it at every turn until you cant stop groaning the suspension of disbelief what every work of fiction aims to achieve once that stops working youre in trouble no you cant drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control no corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel im not a scientist but there were many times when i said wait what that doesnt sound right anyway i think i reached the minimum number of characters so i can stop do not pay to see this movie enough saidi was very much disappointed by this flat action movie and its predictable ending i am a fan of the old missionimpossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore i think the plot is ridiculous at best why should jim phelps do what he did? he was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team the reason why peter graves jim phelps did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what i have just said anyway this movie is not for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series it is a one man show for tom cruisei was very disappointed with this film i cannot understand why anyone would complain about the complexity of the plot compared to an average episode of the tv show the story was simple meaning that one action follows the other and nothing really unexpected happens in other words it is very constructed and you can sense it for example the way in the terminal room is much too easy i think in a tv episode the writer would have invented much more tricks the thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told in addition to that some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly for example the helicopter in the tunnel not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of jim or the stereotypic dialogues i will not spend a cent for watching part 2i was very disappointed after seeing this movie especially after having read so many positive reviews the portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudoscientific and so preposterous that i found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie i dont have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even i found myself bothered by them even for a scifi its far too liberal in this regard but thats not the only problem with this movie the characters are paperthin and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner for example an ex nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret nasa base which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates  makes so much sense huh? where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the following day because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators whereas the protagonist has flown before many years back and only barely leaving the atmosphere but thats fine theyre sure he can manage an intergalactic journey involving many years of travel deepspace hibernation traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind no need for any training or a medical check of course surely hell be just fine he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch incredibly when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever  traveling through a wormhole he and his crewmates just play it cool the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park there are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie a movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science youd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chitchat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level nasa scientists professors and engineers would use this is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence ill end by saying i really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best scifi movie ever it seems to me that were stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great its almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positivei was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review my first oneever okay so to begin with i thoroughly enjoyed the film prior to the last 20 mins it was highly entertaining humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job i did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point this movie wouldve made it on my top rated list so youre probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me so let me tell you now bear in mind that i am a woman in my mid 30s and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where eggsy the main character is propositioned by an imprisoned princess what is so wrong with that you ask? nothinghad she not offered her ahole in exchange for him saving the world why? it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film it was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful such a shame because it was such a great film tooi was really excited from seeing the review score on here and all the hype i had heard from other people via social media i eagerly pressed play the initial opening scene was quite intense and moving and i was quite taken aback by how that went i wondered if this level of intensity would set the bar for character development throughout the film and i was immediately grasped my illusions were soon dashed as the film fast forwards to when the boy is grown up and is stealing an item he is most definitely not grown up and a complete idiot i guess this bit is meant to appeal to 6 yr olds? it is almost as bad as trump jokes i cringed i let it slide and hoped for better it got exciting when the chase scene was happening then they went to prison then they broke out and then they tried to sell the item that pretty much summarises the whole film the main protagonist is a buffoon who swears a few times for good measure kids watch this film the only character that seemed to develop was draxx as he reflects on his poor choices the bad guy isnt even scary  he doesnt do that much compare the bad guy to loki and the difference is infinite no character development apart from a 1 minute scene with draxx the annoying rocket character that had zero impact a non entity villain a weak weak weak plot line and the dialogue was so flimsy in fact most of the characters flip flopped around in reasons to do things that didnt really make logical sense the only saving graces were the planet scenery and make up i hesitate to say the cinematography as it was cgi the worst bit out of many was where the racoon decided he wanted a mans prosthetic limb to escape the prison and then sniggered about how he wanted to see the guy hop about  i actually found this really offensive and dont want my children to think that is a funny and b ok the best bit was the soundtrack overall a very disappointing disjointed film it felt as jarring as star trek into darkness coupled with star wars jar jar binks and a smidge of the goonies but nowhere near as goodi was looking forward to seeing this film but the points i would give it is nothing out of 10 everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness writing acting absolutely unconvincing and you knew what they were going to say before they said it i hope that is not the american way of life because its unreal the word they use throughout the film is awesome and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five i would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede it would have given me a great deal more pleasure it is a film i wouldnt say is a turkey but a massive pork pie with plenty of jelly even that sounds quite nice i am always thoughtful about films i love films and the film that leaves the memory lingering is jet boy a remarkable canadian film i would give that 8510 if anybody wants to waste their time in totality get this film for £10 remember you have been warned i put the film straight in the firei was genuinely excited to hear that disney was going to make a film about maleficent my favorite disney villain of all time i was interested in knowing the why behind her actions in sleeping beauty since we never really got to see that i will say that the cinematography is amazing i will also say that while angelina jolie was not my first choice she had the look her costume was spoton and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly and really who could replace eleanor audley? but one thing ive noticed over the past 1015 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus rather than story or character development in the movie maleficents back story was incredibly rushed so much for going into depth on why maleficent is the way she is this movie does not explain why maleficent is the way she is disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as disneys most iconic villain now theyre trying to say that maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil but that never happens she becomes angry and bitter but not evil maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood sympathetic character she is a total victim who never becomes evil at all oh she does do one evil thing she does still curse king stefans baby out of revenge and she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward see? not evil at all and while im at it i should mention my distaste for the way she cursed aurora disney completely lowered the stakes by having maleficent utter the words sleeplike death and be the one to offer the cure of true loves kiss no its merryweather that counters the death curse in order to save auroras life oh maleficent may say later that she doesnt believe true love exists but thats a matter of opinion isnt it? again lowers the stakes and what was linda woolverton thinking when she took king stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make maleficent look good? if youre going to show us the point of view of a famous villain its okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi dimensional even to show they werent always evil but not to say they were never evil at all that just completely defeats the point of the character same with the good guys they may have their own flaws show that they have their own prejudices or that everything they did wasnt perfect but not to say the good guys were really evil or stupid the fairies flora fauna and merryweather i refuse to call them by their new names are nothing like they were in sleeping beauty and this is a big deal in sleeping beauty say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping aurora safe at least they tried even if they failed maleficent 2014 portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins aurora was just a means to an end for them they have no relationship with her like they do in the original the movie also took away their own personalities so they are no different from each other i cant even keep track of which fairy has which name watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as i expected it to be king stefan has to be one of worst written villains i have seen in a while he has no real motivation for what he does we see him as having nothing in the beginning and then the movie glosses over his relationship with maleficent in order to get to the good part where he steals her wings in order to be king after that he wages war on maleficent for cursing his daughter and yet he only looks at aurora as afterthought property why is he even after maleficent then? what else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter? elle fanning as aurora was very impressive i do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original and she stole the film in every scene she was in unfortunately that wasnt enough to save the movie nor were maleficents interactions with diaval as enjoyable as they were and of course maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie i have to ask why disney? you knew how loved of a villain maleficent is and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why also we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant you didnt use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with liveaction cgi? why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? besides the fact that maleficent is not evil in this film she also is very wimpy and pathetic she cant do anything when we see her fight an army at the beginning all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings the tree monsters did most of her fighting for her in sleeping beauty she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds she could shoot lightning from her staff and she could transform into another form other than her own she didnt do any of that in this movie just like with alice in wonderland disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the liveaction screen maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie ive seen but its definitely in my bottom list nowi was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out boy what a waste of excitement angelina jolie was terrible i swear she only had about 30 lines in the whole movie most of her scenes were of her posing in her costume and looking or trying to look evil stick with the original sleeping beauty movie if you want a movie with an actual plot whoever made this movie focused on what it looked like and the cgi more then the actual acting which was horrendous the whole movie was just eye candyabsolutely no depth to it whatsoever no more angelina jolie movies the woman cant act at all all of these big blockbuster overhyped movies have no depth or plot its like they put all of their energy and money into the visual appeal of the movie and said to hell with it when it came to the actual acting and plot such a shamei was expecting a lot more from this weak and slightly laughable movie johnny depp is literally sleep walking he has all the presence of a cardboard cut out and seems like he just doesnt care depp plays dr will caster a genius who takes technology all the way by working out how to upload a human consciousness into a quantum computer well lots of them a terrorist attack sees the doctor poisoned with weeks to live so his wife evelyn rebecca hall and best friend max waters paul bettany do the unthinkable they upload him this idea is not new there have been other films with a similar idea and also a twilight zone episode the character of joseph tagger morgan freeman could have been played by anyone as the character had no substance what so ever and freeman was predictable and unchallenged there is a ghost town that ends up home to the doctors mega lab locals made invincible and joined like the borg on star trek the entire government is represented by one man the army by a few more the terrorist wind up working with the good guys to stop the doctor never mind that they where the ones who killed the doctor in the first place well his body anyway its silly and it ends badly but not too soon for mei was anticipating this movie as i was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s what a major disappointment this was the film begins ok but then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that hollywood churns out so often cruse is totally misscast and unconvincingthe point of the series was its cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things this was just the biggest disappointment on film i have seen apart from the even worse 2 follow ups i am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film but mission impossible it is not and jim phelps turning traitor? pleasei was actually intrigued by this movie a spy movie with action and comedy i love those types of movies the beginning started out good i actually liked this movie until all the killing dont get me wrong im not one of those antikilling people movie type person my problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story the story lol especially the fireworks scene in the movie yes the special effects were cool in all but come on fireworks? when youre gonna kill a bunch of people you turn it into a fireworks show that part completely ruined it for me onto the story i got the basic plot of the story but once again the killing kept distracting me away from the story in conclusion the movie had a lot of potential but did not live up to my expectations i do have the admit cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the filmi waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed i dont understand where the 10 reviews came from? what planet were they on perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole i have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations plot was ambiguous storyline convoluted technology was not linear one sees a 20th century saturn v lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap exploratory craft that operate like a star wars movie landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesnt affect craft in orbit? cant these people survey the world from orbit? black holes 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection shameless referrals to 2001 it was embarrassing on and on for way too long han zimmers music score was good with a few good special effects but that was iti vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are bad at logic unreasonable for adult if this movie is for 012 kidsand not marvel presents i will not say anything and wont recommend any friends to see it in my impressionmarvel is a very good movie maker and always surprised me but this and thor 12there are very serious logical problems to make you feel vulgar there are tons of good movie on imdb top listfor kids if you think this is marvel presents watch this just waste your time and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdbi vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are

character development and depth then i realised that there was still over 1 hour to goand nothing had happenedand nothing looks like it will happen and i dont care what happens just make it stop so i didi stopped watching now i am relieved because moments agoi turned into peter finch and began raving im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore what is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie i dont care what happens to the boy the mom the sister or that dad i am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality fantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty i hated this i usually dont write these reviews but i am so antiinspired and this way would like to warn people if you dont like first 10 mins everything later will be even worse i thought that skyline is worst movie ever but after watching this one i am really not sure the plot doesnt lead anywhere almost all characters have horrible personalities they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives scenes are lasting too long and for many i find no reason of including them to the movie the movie lasts too long and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it you realised it was total waste of time just dont make the same mistakei used to watch the 80s series remake of mission impossible and feel this movie is largely mission impossible in title only its really just a big star vehicle and moneymaking enterprise for tom cruise sure its an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all youre after the revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself it really wasnt anything like the 80s mission impossible i remember what about the comraderie between characters? what about the team effort thing? these things are missing because its tom cruise vs the rest of the world the best thing about the film is larry mullen jnr and adam clayton from u2 being on the soundtracki understand the appeal of superheroaction comic stories the good guys are purely good and noble and selfsacrificing and easy to pick out because theyre really good looking and wed like to think of ourselves as those things or potentially those things if we could just get around to putting down the doritos and remote and having a meaningful job and life the bad guys are just as easy to pick out though many of them are good looking too in this version of the ofttold tale at some point though we grow up and all this comic book ethos is revealed to be a ridiculous and childish take on a complex human world where no one is purely good and few are purely evil but its still appealing to some level of us thats still stuck in our childhood moral upbringing where ma and pop told us about right and wrong and we still wish it were that simple and clear and that bullies got their comeuppance some people never grow up and see this sort of thing for what it iswishful simplistic thinking others know what it is but find it appealing anyway for the part of me that is such a person a couple stars for doing a decent job of it in this show this show is also full of extremely good looking people any heterosexual female is going to dampen herer palms watching this the action scenes are unevensome pretty good and interesting and some fakey and in violation of the laws of physics the presentday plots are utterly predictable the resolutions simpleminded as is the romance the backstory scenes were interesting in the first few episodes but paled quickly as of this writing the show has gotten repetitive already minus three stars for immediate fake negative votes of the first version of this review in case the shows makers paid for those which is a sleazy practice i watched all the shows said to be the best of the fall 2012 season for at least two eps each and this is indeed one of the better ones but its not actually goodi truly believe that all these giant user reviews with 10 stars are just paid to review it this movie is a massive disappointment seeing it again will not change anything its just down right boring it is over hyped to no end do not waste your time and money seeing this in the theater this movie has a rating up near the shawshank redemption it does not even come close to being that good of a movie when the shawshank redemption is on tv you dont turn it off no one does because that is an example of a great movie if i never hear about this movie again that is all that will salvage it in my mind some of the visuals were nice but that is about it they werent great it was few and far between and honestly i dont know how you can even try to bank on the visuals because it was basically like any other space movie there was nothing that set it apart in my mind i couldnt even consider being impressed by any aspect of this movie it should be put on a shelf and forgotten christopher nolan should go back to making batman moviesi thought the film was totally awful bad script bad acting bad music and especially bad taste it pretends to mock james bond but with no style whatsoever they are using young people to tell a story that has no moral and is totally unrealistic it seems like a celebration of violence with countless bloody scenes that make you sick they are not offering any interesting points of view but telling a cheap story through violence sexism and clichs including a blond princess i dont see why anyone would want to watch this film and i dont recommend it to anyone i also feel pretty bad about the cast who have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this filmi

have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this filmi thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star even though its maybe  at best  a 4 because this is definitely not worth 8 guardians of the galaxy was a shot i chose to try in god knows how long since ive been to the cinema this is just another load of hollywood trash i had the impression it was innovative considering the guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing but i was wrong in the beginning whatshisname is on earth and it is apparently 88 the kids mother dies ok is this meant to be emotional despite the fact i have no attachment to any of these characters yet? oh wow its the future now im sorry his mother dies he goes outside and then he gets abducted? what is this supposed to signify? not to mention its obviously unbelievably and strangely timed but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character but really doesnt do anything for the major plot of the entire film the rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison because what happens when youre arrested together is you share a block not to mention gender is no issue here then they fall into this orb situation what is it? it it is this orb and it is powerful a bit like the cube or something there was little development in the story at all really a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising i dont even know i was almost asleep half the time i was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over so we have hideous cgi here ridiculously unprofessional but i guess im not in with the cgi in blockbusters they have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems having the ability to do these things doesnt make it cool it just looks like a video game another thing visually was the designs it was just so typical of the actionscifi genre in the technology and whatnot and the characters very much in the same boat but moreso thrown together effortlessly then after that its all explosions  speeding  advertising  hitting in between theres a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe the best kind and in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay overall >the comedy was horrid >the story was simple >the characters were lacking in everything really the cinematography didnt even involve cameras >the soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together so what was good about it? the action1111 wait no >the action was too much unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time main reason i even saw this was i received an invitation from some mates i think ill try go back to sticking to films with a point the only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucksi thought it was a complete waste of time to go to the cinema to watch this movie where to start? the plot is ridiculous the script is simple and not genuine the characters are weak and afflecks acting is terrible it seems like they try too hard to make the impression the story is complex but this worsens it even more in general this movie makes you feel nothingis not believable and i really dont know how can someone launch a movie like this and not feel any shame i respect this director very much but this work is not at all close to what he has done before i have to say it is one of the worst movies i have ever seeni think back to this movie and have no feeling for italthough i remember all of the scenesthere is no emotion or empathy that i feelit was three hours of watching nothingnessin my opinion i could have been watching my or my friends life storiesbut ours are probably more exciting than this ludicrous film it was apparently filmed over twelve years why? they could have hired different actors as time went by and made this movie in a few monthsi dont see it as artistic or unique in any waya young boy grows uplike all of us in different ways there are various issuesdivorced parentsbeing bullied in high schooletc so what? i compare this film to a fascinating british series called the seven up series a small group of british childrenaged sevenfrom various backgrounds and classes were interviewed every seven yearsuntil aged fifty sixthey were followednot all of them continued to participate later on but most of them didit was amazing to see what had happened to them in comparison to what their initial thoughts were when they were seven years oldi loved that seriesit was cleverinterestingunique and i couldnt wait to see what had happened to these kidsin boyhoodby comparisoni couldnt care at all what happens to masonhis sisterhis mom played by patricia arquette or his dadethan hawki was left with an empty feeling why did i waste three hours watching this boring film which masquerades as art? pleasedont let it win best picture at the golden globes oroscar awards i will be completely turned off hollywood movies dont waste your money on this drivelwatch it for free when its on tv if you are really curiousi saw the trailer expecting this to be an extraordinary movie angelina jolies looks is perfect for the part the effects promised to be nothing short of awesome and the glimpse at the dragon woke up delightful memories of fear from the day i saw the original cartoon movie with my mom a long time ago i bought the tickets to see it in 3d with my daughters and i could anticipate the atmosphere of malevolence from the dark maleficent then it all changed in the name of doing something different and to surprise the audience the screenplay writers threw a wonderfully balanced story out the window and decided to make a nonsensical parody instead who do they think they are? to second guess writers that have thrilled whole generations of people and produce this garbage in the name of the box office? not only did they alter the essence of the story but they made a total confusion out of the message of good versus evil what? bad is good and good is bad? or is it good sometimes and bad in others? what will the kids think? do the screenplay writers really expect that the kids will readily understand how despair and betrayal can turn someone into a vengeful person? does it even have a place in this story? of course not kids may need to be taught reality in real life but when they are told a story taking place in an imaginary world they expect something straightforward so that a message stands clearly out the only good thing that can come out of this is that someone somewhere makes a remix of this movie the way it should be done filling the blanks with the original cartoon masterpiece shame on you disney studios watch snow white and the hunter and learn how a classic story should be told and especially how far it can be altered without losing its essencei saw the trailer and the science of interstellar on youtube and i felt compelled to watch the movie oh boy the movie was such a disappointment there no respect for science in interstellar the movie is a waste of time and money it was without logic and too long i dont understand how such an awful movie can have 910 stars its beyond my comprehension the music is to loud and for nothing there is no real tension after reading the 1010 reviews i felt compelled to register an account on imdb to say how awful the movie was stay way please or youll regret it from now on i will never rely on imdb reviews when it comes to decide what to watch imdb you disappointed mei saw the rating of 83 at the imdb and wanted to watch the movie the movie started well but then it moved into the same lame side of the universethe movie brings nothing new to us it was like watching avengers againor any other superhero movie where the superheroes fight with each other at the beginning but then unite to fight a common enemy the movie was packed with inappropriate and lame humour the acting was below average marvels should really consider the type of movies that they r making i am still shocked that how on earth that this movie got an 83 ratings this surely effects the credibility of imdbi saw all the positive reviews for maleficent so i went to watch it in the cinemas with high hopes i wish i had ignored the reviews maybe i went in with too great an expectation but ive marked and graded 8th grade creative writing papers with more substance and plot when you can call the conflict and resolution as soon as it is being set up you know more thought was put into the cgi than actual story development and the casting oh god the only person who was logically cast was jolie dont even get me started on the child actors there were many times where i turned and looked at everyone else watching to see if they were reacting positively to what was on screen i found a couple breaking out the cards and playing a game of bluff the ending quote and fade to black was met with a what the f was that? by the audience and a bunch of laughing and booing if you require more than pretty colours to entertain you save your money and time for any other film maleficent gets a star for its beautiful cgi work and costume design but falls flat in every other respecti remember seeing this movie in the theater after that i saw it at least once on vhs maybe twice i picked up the bluray of this used from a blockbuster that was closing ive been more interested in seeing spyaction movies recently and it seemed like something i should revisit i wish i hadnt bought it there are so many problems with this movie nearly all of which have to do with the script first i dont care about anyone on the team cruise doesnt come across as having a personality and he doesnt behave like a skilled agent everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable second the plot had potential to be an interesting story provided that the story was treated a little more like the ateam with them trying to prove their innocence instead we wind up with a story where we arent positive why cruise is doing anything except for some vague idea and it comes across confusing because its hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal third because of the first two i find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie i couldnt care less if cruise lives or dies the movie hasnt aged well the pacing is strange and once again computers are relegated to be magic boxes and the action sequences seem to be silly when cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank i couldnt keep from laughing the big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness but it was very very close now i have to figure out what to do with this bluray copy that i really will never look at againi rely on imdb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch rating of 92 looks so attractive that i didnt even bother to check the trailer i went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed as i was watching it i was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didnt even by the last scene it was a total bollywood drama where hero doesnt die no matter where he is the most funny part was when he press the eject button in space it does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination it was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park awful movie total waste of time and money please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thingi really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer now having seen it what an awful movie _ although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstringstugging opening in the hospital it rapidly becomes the same old shoot em up that you have seen innumerable times the special effects are good but the fightbattle scenes are too frenetic to be able to follow the action clearly i also found the plot torturous and difficult to follow due to the proliferation of double crosses unclear explanation of who the bad guys are and then the bad guys behind the bad guys confusion with all the different places empires etc and their interrelationships some of the dialogue was execrable with chris pratt talking like a dude from 2014 ironic considering he was abducted by aliens decades agoi really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews

like this movie and while it does have a few positive points on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming dont waste your money on this stinkeroo parents note this is not the movie you want to take your children to see it is one of the most graphically violent movies i can ever remember seeing comic decapitations are still decapitations there is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax one of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together a large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction director matthew vaughn has no ability to reign in the more hammish actors samuel l jackson pulls out all the stops  and basically ruins every scene he is in jacksons performance has to be the worst of his long career it may well be one of the worst performances of the decade his character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels he chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate or perhaps that he has a speech impediment  motivation is not an issue here  dont look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie fans of colin firth jack davenport mark hamill and michael caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated on a positive note taron egerton is a delight he has enough skills to overcome the horrible direction and ham handed performancesi really like the series with peter grave 171 episodes between 1966 and 1973 and 35 episodes between 1988 and 1990 who shows jim phelps and his team saving the good against the bad and make of the character of jim phelps a traitor was too much for me it was simply disrespectful for all person who knows the 2 series it was better to kill the character in mission than make him an traitor now if i forget the series my vote will be an 6 the train under the channel was really too much an helicopter behind a train in a tunnel the explosion of this helicopter who only punch tom cruise back on the train the rest of the movie was better i like the scene with the explosion of the aquarium sorry for my english but my mothertongue is frenchi really like nolan and like all of its films until i saw interstellar the movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of time waste this is one movie that i really wanted to see but in between the movie i was thinking when is this going to get over i think nolan could not decide between making a scifi movie and an emotional movie he has given an average movie and because its a nolan movie i have given it a 1star i know it doesnt really deserve 1star but then i am angry with imdb there is no way it should be rated 9 i think lately imdb has become a hub where marketing people raise the rating through any means available disappointed in nolan and imdb too i really dont see how everyone is giving such great reviews of this movie its one giant plot hole from which no stars can escape say what you like about nolans film making style but this movie should have never been made throughout the overly long self indulgent piece of crap i said many times that this movie had better end really well of course its just one notch above the worst ending i can think of for it i think they killed all the consultants off before they started filming too just save yourselves run dont watch iti really cant enjoy a clich_ like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful childish movie like guardians of the galaxy cheap jokes and laughs seen that done that scenes bad guys and visual effects i didnt care much for any of the characters in the movie and the powerful connection between the members of the team had to be the most important part of it nobody was funny there werent any cool jokes and creative and visually stunning scenes it was just another scifi ripoff from the major productions in the genre huge disappointment dont watch it 85??? people are weird not the moviei really cant enjoy a clich like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful

ripoff from the major productions in the genre huge disappointment dont watch it 85??? people are weird not the moviei really cant believe that this movie has such a high rating in imdb generally movies above 8 should be a must see ones and this one fails big time in the must see list if you are for a mindless action movie with some bond lines from the 80s yes this is something that you will enjoy if however you want to see something enjoyable with nice humor and an actual interesting plot then please dont watch this one youll definitely waste your time what you get here is something that you know the end in the first 5 minutes i mean come on the struggle to be accepted in the high society and the movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have money or you are a clever person then you will be welcomed everywhere in the world also the jokes are flat and you have to be 15 years old to actually laugh all in all you get a lousy plot with lousy lines and a soso action with some cgi effects thanks but no thanksi read some opinions from different users before watching the movie and even got excited about the idea of paying my entrance for guardians of the galaxy but was absolutely disappointed because what i found was once again as many major blockbusters do a weak plot and lots of action scenes without an strong story behind and when a movie lacks an story it feels like an amount of nonsense battles and a compendium of action heroes against bad guys i really like the characters of the film but the quality of a movie cannot rely on the strenght of undeveloped characters star wars is still ligth years ahead from these guardians sorry waste of money and timei never write reviews about movies but having seen the ratings on this site i have to say something to stop people from being misled about this so called blockbuster the movie is total rubbish and made no sense the acting is dreadful and watching it after an hour made me wish everyone died so i could end my pain 3 hours of my life that i will never get back do not waste your time watching this movie and if you do just remember i warned you first ps i have also noticed that all the 1010 reviews are from many non english speaking countries and just i wonder if they have all been paid to boost the ratings of this publicity driven awful movie stay cleari must say that i really didnt like this film all that much though since i had seen the first i felt that maybe i should go and see the second one though i am having second thoughts as to whether i will go and see any more basically the film follows on from the first film where the divergents have fled the city and are now hiding out with one of the factions that lives out in the country however this what were it was a little confusing at the end of the first film i thought they have fled behind the wall however it turns out that they hadnt but instead were hiding out in one of the rural areas secondly i though much of the city had been rebuilt and from what i can remember of the first film chicago was nowhere near as ruined as it was in this film basically the villain comes across this box hidden in one of the ruins and realises that she must find a divergent to be able to open it so she sends out her guards namely the members of dauntless who remained loyal to her to track them all down as it turns out trix is the one divergent that is able to open the box however the problem is that she is in hiding as are all the other divergents however that is all i really feel that i can say about this film i thought it was boring the acting was pretty ordinary and i ended up sitting in my seat for the two hours that the film went for quite uncomfortable and waiting for it to end it seemed that i enjoyed the first film and obviously there will be a conclusion but a part of me simply wants to read the wikipedia entry for the book so i dont have to spend anytime sitting around the cinema watching it when i could be doing something else i hope they dont go and do what they did with the hunger games and split the final book into two movies but we will see when they get around to releasing iti must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers the movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters i felt nothing for the characters and i really wanted to there were a few moments when i was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements but nobodynothing got spaghettafied neil degrasse tysons descriptionterm it is really a love story disguised as a scifi fantasy and not even a very good love story i was so bored i fell asleep for about 15 minutes i felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but i thought maybe if i stayed it would get better it didnt i really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better they tried but it didnt help can i get my money back? how many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? they could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this countryi may drop a few spoilers here so be warned i find it very hard to understand why so many people thought this movie was so good yes there was a good cast yes the special effects were good in this day and age that is expected but the story? teaching that space travel to the moon was a hoax? whats that about? the farmer just happens to be a trained astronaut? his daughter just happens to be a mathematical genius? the lies that are told and this intelligent astronaut is so gullible? the denigration of education as if that is any positive way to save mankind? the striving by the government to have more farmers when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive the belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life? who thought this up? the same people who strive for an uneducated populace? and amid all this somehow commuter space travel is developed? too much bull for me to swallow really folks?????i may be too harsh giving guardians of the galaxy such a poor rating but i have to be honest this movie is garbage i suspect that the people who give it such high praises are nothing but marvel fanboys gotg is boring really really boring the movie tries to be funny but falls flat with one bad joke after another rocket raccoon who is obviously supposed to be the funniest character since he is the most sarcastic and has the most oneliners is painfully unfunny anyway i laughed a little bit at the beginning the rest of the time i stared blankly at the screen periodically glancing at my watch the action sequences only contributed to the boringness of the movie why? theres no risk to the main characters it is obvious that they wont be killed the danger is never convincing enough to raise the pulse guardians of the galaxy is a bad moviei love scifi thrillers and all i hated this one there is something fundamentally wrong with this movie the story reads as an excuse an excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes the film tried so much that ended up failing in everything i think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with bandaid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie i would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working it is that bad i sincerely hope i make it i have been drooling ever since i left the cinemai love scifi and so hoped that this movie would be great given the reviews but it is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen do not waste your time or money there are no emotional or intellectual catalysts behind this worse than b movie film who gives a damn about such stupid undeveloped characters? i am groot this is the best line of the film and groot a living tree is the best character enough said? if you like stupid campy scifi films smoke some dope and maybe youll like this one if you want to listen to 1970s pop music get a cassette tape such a disappointment wasted 2 hours of my lifei love marvel whether it be xmen thor the avengers spiderman iron man most of the commonly known ones of course but i always loved them but to put this as simply as i can though that doesnt mean this will be short this film was filled with 1000 of the most common clichs extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashedup jumpy unreserved ridiculous abnormal spiteful detestable idiotic moronic absurd ludicrous senseless meaningless pointless terriblywritten unbelievably unrealistic supersupersuperherowannabe movie that very desperately and obviously and obnoxiously attempts to specialeffect everything and i mean everything to simply gain some big bucks because hey its marvel what could go wrong? its sad to see how successful their attempts were i fell for it for me its all due to the avengers because that was freaking amazing even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff and boy do i regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage basically its a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space no seriously of course everything is colorful there its not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called dark for a reason so yeah totally makes sense and your skin also starts rotting in outerspace too serious case of leprosy then? i liked elektra more than this id rather have watched that five times kind of feel like that says something the only reasons i smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes puns and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless they should have gone with comedy rather than actionadventure though since i sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk call me a spoilsport if you must but i was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me usually im not very good at predicting what happens in films unless they are seriously full of clichswhich this film is but i said them anyway i was right 8 times out of 9 i counted anyway though the beautiful graphics did rival that of avatar the plot of saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so its not just earth thats being targeted this time so ha we are different never got this tiring i was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was maybe that was intentional and marvel fans just wanted to see some new more unique heroes this time and also to see the visuals and maybe to see chris pratt and zoe saldanas pretty buttsbut whatever i had half that mind prepared for a clichturned awesome movie when i walked in the theater i came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure so plot would have been old and good but it wasnt protagonists i would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didnt blow up almost everyones favorite guy and kept alive some peoples leastliked guys so yeah villains  oh my gosh no seriously? what even happened to the evil robot woman? did the filmmakers just completely forget her? music louder than inceptions horn and i loved that even though it had no tune couldnt stand this though but still be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that i would have downloaded if they didnt play those songs during totally inappropriate moments comedy relief my butt the only relief i got out of the soundtrack that isnt even their soundtrack hopefully they didnt violate any copy rights i mean if its these filmmakers i wouldnt be surprised is that im glad groot enjoyed himself visuals stunning that wasnt sarcastic at all at all what else? oh yeah unless you pay me a million dollars i would never watch the sequel so sorry i cant contribute ten dollars for marvel next time tough luck dont let this review stop you though most of my friends liked it and of course most people who reviewed this movie liked it so i guess im just a jerk im betting you readers agree and thats totally understandable since i am totally venting but hey three out of four of my friends never watched a marvel movie so call me bluffing but i sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments i have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marveli love marvel whether it be xmen thor the

still going to watch xmen though dang you marveli love good superhero films captain america superman iron man this is not one of them if id been alone i would have walked out and the last time i did that in a cinema was for the wedding singer its not without merit but with $170 million spent i would hope not the design overall is very good the effects also and unlike some i liked chris pratt and the ronan actor but the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon characters grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes the film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste but at least it does not take itself seriously we are thankful for small mercies enough said i will go out of my way to avoid james gunn films in futurei love dramatic movies i love scifi movies i love most of christopher nolans work i was so excited to see interstellar after all the 1010 reviews but after seeing it i was thoroughly disappointed my actual rating is probably 610 i rated 110 to balance the other ratings spoilers ahead here are my major problems with this movie 1over dramatized effects throughout 2every character except for 3 of them was just a redshirt with no characterization just created to be killed off 3the science aspect was stupid especially in the second half 4did this highly developed 5d race have any way to save humans besides creating a room that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5the ending was a thorough disappointment everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? they never explain why that data is even useful 6poorly designed and explained apocalypse earth didnt seem to be in much peril 7okay when mann blew the airlock couldnt the others just tell him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying dont do it its not the right decision 8really? the voice of corruption is called mann? that was a stupid metaphor 9i dont think there was even enough water on millers planet to make waves those big seeing as it wasnt even knee deep 10just wasnt what it was cracked up to be the film was heavily lacking in character development and plot the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid parts that i liked no it didnt all suck 1tarz was pretty cool he was unique compared to all other robots from scifi movies ive seen 2the highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation and there were some good special effects 3i didnt fall asleep which is good i just cant believe so many people are raving over this movie its like theyre too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasnt any good people try to tell me the science in this movie couldve made sense because its not discovered yet i think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak english would have been more believable its worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is but dont expect too muchi looked forward to seeing this film so i was excited today i watched it it started badly i couldnt understand what the characters were mumbling later on i found this a god send it awful a real mess  badly made most of the time i had no idea what was going on too many characters introduced so quickly six different locations in ten minutes i hate itill never watch it again i only watched it to see if would improve but no it got worseif the comic was like this well its no wonder i have never heard of them beforethe tiny bits of humor are the only things that made em pay attention to anythingi wouldnt recommend this to anybodyi just recently watched the series from beginning to the present episodes such promise the show has slowly deteriorated into a scifi soap opera to oliver thea is not really your sister shes your half sister from a man your mother had an affair with whom she now hates or hated because she is now dead or is she? that man is dead now or was dead and is now training your half sister to be a killer why did she stop hating him? oh and the love of her life roy is being replaced by a dj olivers main concern is bedding every female in the cast while those around him slowly find out who he really is the whole show reminds me of the heroes series because it seems that week to week they dont know where the story is going so they change things at the drop of a hat and hope people go along with iti just finished watching this movie and have to say what the heck is wrong with hollywood? do they not have writers that any frigging common sense how hard is it to make a movie that is logical engaging and doesnt insult your intelligence you could try and suspend rational thought and just try to watch it for entertainment but thats impossible to do in this movie because there is no suspense no serious action frankly its pretty boring the premise completely defies logic first there is no way the government would not have been all over the notsosecret unguarded facility really depp was supposed to be a super intelligence why would he set up in an unguarded section in the us? depp is supposed to be in the internet with access to any file but he couldnt find out about the governmentterrorist plot? the script screws itself up depp rewrote his code so it was totally unbelievable that a virus could have been created in a few minutes stupid the whole premise of the movie was stupid technology is bad and any advancements must be destroyed this concept was so stupid depp  s character was curing people the environment there was nothing evil about what he was doing the writing was terrible the reason the terrorists wanted to destroy depp  s creation is stupid it makes no sense there was no build up of depp  s character going from good to evil the lawn mower man did a way better job of showing how the characters went from nice to homicidal maniac it was just plain stupid to set the premise that depp had become the smartest super computer but he acted like he had the iq of a 2 year old dont waste your time on this unintelligent moviei just an advanced screening of this movie and felt i had to write about it i expected so much from this director wally pfister and cast and i just feel so let down it seems this movie is meant to be a pure scifi with a great message at its heart but it just wasnt good points it has a great cast it looks great good cinematography the cgi was a good standard but not mind blowing bad points major plot holesits also very dull i can usually take the mrs into a scifi movie and although she wont enjoy it on the same level i would she would be able to sit through it good thing i watched it on my own as she would not be able to stomach this in fact i was seriously bored there are no sub plots there are no twists and turns in fact not much happened ********* this part of the review contains major spoilers ***************** there is no real explanation of how they upload the mind of the main scientist  other than some reference to a monkey brain that another scientist managed to achieve then there is the whole building of an entire datacentre  the one the size of a small city underground by a contractor who seems to only have experience in building cafes and houses why does the government not notice that an entire town has been taken over? once the nanites are everywhere why not just infect the whole world? why does the ai not just suicide itself instead of allowing itself to be infected? then there is the idea that max writes a virus to destroy the ai that was created  exactly how does this man out wit the greatest intelligence in the history of the world? how does max infect evelyn? just because max works in ai how does that mean he could write this amazing virus into a human being? ok maybe i am a little biased i have a degree in computer science and i work as full time software developer so maybe i know a bit too much but still **** end of spoilers ****** the entire movie felt flat on its face it invoked no emotion whatsoever there was no wow moment there was no edge of your seat thriller it was a dull scifi movie with a big budget and a great cast i love scifi and thrillers and i am a huge chris nolan fan so i had high hopes for this also please mr pfister go back to doing cinematography with chris nolani heard a lot of squealing about this movie and expected better but its very conventional and follows the same ol story arc as movies it is supposedly mocking the characters are a tad snide and make a few quips but other than that this movie is extremely middleofthe road the only lead character with any screen presence was the big wrestler guy as for the lead if that dude walked by me on the street i totally would not recognize him no star power here no screen presence zoe saldana is starting to get typecast as space babe she should take another kind of role soon bradley coopers character was downright annoying an angry little animated character is not new or groundbreaking we dont even get a dynamic bad guy people everyone knows that if you want your movie to be kickass you have to make your bad guy dynamic weirdly sexyor at the very least british this is known as the alan rickman principle this bad guy was just some weird blue dude who apparently drooled a lot while eating black licorice and forgot to wipe his mouth off this movie is a giant hohumi have seen birdemic birdemic 2 the room sharknado and etcetera but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film the aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness boyhood is neither funny nor inspiring or anything positive for that matter halfway through the film i felt myself wishing that ellar coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced the concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind unfortunately nothing else was remotely interesting please save yourself 3 hours and do something else eat some dirt lick a bee smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare anything and i mean anything is better than this filmi have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller? no way it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged meeven after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at alli have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time back i have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time backi have never wrote a review in my life ever but i feel compelled to do so for this film im utterly shocked just shocked this movie has an 84 rating what on earth are people thinking? seriously? i could go on and on about how the plot is a complete joke but ill just point out the most obvious of all that totally shatters any believably that this film ever had okay amy said desi came to her house and kidnapped her that morning huh? she had no clue what he was really doing that morning none what if he had a meeting with ten other people that could account for him not being at her house? what if he was having breakfast with someone that morning? ok next now how about the diary? so did desi kidnap her then grab the diary and bring it to a house he had no clue even existed and burn only about 20% of it? next when she pretends to be screaming with blood on her dress against the window so the surveillance cameras would see her seriously? what about all the other footage those cameras captured? for example her and desi sitting together on a couch watching tv oh she deleted that footage? well what the hell is her explanation for all the footage being erased except the 20 seconds of her screaming this is not me nitpicking the film and looking super hard to try and find problems i get it a lot of movies have plot holes here and there and im okay with that but people these are huuuuge holes in the story plot holes are in tons of movies all the time but not usually a major motion picture with a major director and a major movie star and please dont tell me shes nuts and thats why she didnt cover her tracks worth a damn i am talking about the fact that she gets away with it to all the law enforcement this belongs on lifetime those movies you can just shrug off what baffles me and actually really upsets me is the fact it has a rating of 84 so please people help me understand this what on earth gives this such a high rating? what were people thinking? what?i have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released i am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding its crap i really kind of liked the idea behind this show i heard some people complaining about the lack of realism but come on its a superhero show a little unrealism ought to be allowed upon watching the first few episodes i kinda hoped that like lots of great television shows the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters once that occurred i reasoned the quality of the show would start to pick up so despite my initial reservations i kept watching and waiting and waiting and waiting it just never happened the plot has remained unimaginative static and predictable the actors are wooden and unsympathetic and the writing is overall just a train wreck i could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next it pains me to see this truly mediocreatbest show get the rating it has received i will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programmingi hated this movie its not just a truly horrible film its so incredibly ultra violent its like the video game grand theft auto with zombies only worse this was the most disgusting type of violence gratuitous and glorified truly over the top the trailer for this movie is 100 % misleading it makes it look like a james bond movie in reality its more like a zombie movie horrible horrible horrible i wish i could unbuy this movie ticket i wish i could unsee this movie its truly the worst movie ive ever seen absolutely disgusting i gave this movie 1 star but if i could i would give it a minus 10 i feel sick to my stomach most definitelyi hated the movie because the end is creepy and weird that she kisses her on the bed while shes dead and then she wakes because it was true love kiss makes me think that she wants to say that there is no true love at all between women and men and that true love only lies between women and women that is kind of gay and pathetic and sick i am very disappointed in the movie  maybe the next movie for disney would be about a love story between two lesbians hows that ? prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throatsi had my doubts before but now i am sure if it disney has sold out recently disney has been releasing films that whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not have been paintbynumbers at best films like the lone ranger thor the dark world and frozen yes frozen its the same disney crap youve seen over and over people dont get me wrong i love disney but not this disney one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck yes you heard right disney did stoop that low i should have known that this film would be garbage from the getgo when they hired alice in wonderland writer melissa woolverton to pen the screenplay and alice in wonderland production designer robert stromberg to direct are you sensing a pattern here? lets touch on that for a moment the mouse house in its infinite wisdom got a production designervfx supervisor who had never directed anything to direct their $200 million blockbuster as a result maleficents beautiful visuals carry no weight and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? even angelina jolie cant pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself what really sank this movie for me was disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the true love twist from frozen literally the exact same twist i have no problem with disney creating a strong independent heroine but if youre going to do that dont have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie in short disney has definitely lost its magic and its going to be tough to get it back dont listen to the positive reviews remember how glowing alice in wonderlands were when it first came out? you have been warnedi had high hopes for this film i am sorry to say interstellar was the worst film i have seen in a long time i have seen many terrible films but none have compelled me to ever write a review of what i thought there is too many things that make this film and i am not going to rant along here i just wanted to say if i could rate this film 01 out of 10 i would plot holes complete disregard for science bad acting better special effects and spacecraft motion physics have been seen in thunderbird puppets storyline has no clue where it is going and many more i would put this film in childrens fantasy category rather than science fictioni had heard quite a bit for mission impossible especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters i knew my parents owned the first mission impossible but due to the crazy antics tom cruise has pulled on well basically everyone he has pretty much turned me off of his movies but i figured to give the mission impossible movies a shot while over all this is an exciting actionspy flicks there were only a few scenes in the movie i felt were worth the watch obviously the exciting scene of tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk the last action sequence of the helicopter and train with ethan and our surprise villain very well thought out unrealistic but exciting to watch over all for movies sake give mission impossible a chance but its nothing i would scream or jump on couches about  410i got something out of this movie i really did it was 35 degrees celsius outside the cinema and all i needed was a three hour nap in cool airconditioning lucky me the latest nolan film just there for the taking it started off as i hoped it would all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the us otherwise known as nowhere the end of the world syrupy americanstyle little kid tugging at the heart strings  my eyelids already beginning to droop even before coop and his daughter murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very jewish daughter inhabit guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director but that was fine i was almost in rem sleep  not having been able to process a word of dialogue from mcconaughey in over 20 minutes pure bliss and it got even better from an insomniacs point of view thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative cgi effects my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of well lets just call it credulity i dont sleep this well at home wait were going through another kubrickstyle time dimension  didnt we just spend half an hour on this planet reusing some special effects this time made to look like giant waves left over from inception? i think so but time warps so nicely when youre practically snoring i think we lost an astronaut somewhere maybe thats the game whos next? i hope its the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist either that or it was origami for dummies maybe that *was* the guy we just lost  hard to tell they all act the same flat as the dialogue thanks guys anyway we can only pray it will be hathaway soon shes starting to keep me awake how can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? but im being unfair i think i remember her trying to act some of this script brave move from an oscar winner im starting to want my money back anyway im roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy were in another galaxys version of antarctica minus the faintest signs of life  this despite because of? the unzipping of a new bad actor fortunately this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and im soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod i think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a dave and hal routine he must think hes in a good movie poor sod did i mention there must have been yards of inception on the cuttingroom floor last time because im watching more and more outtakes? gotta save a few million here and there i had a dream i dreamed that nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick but they carried me out on a stretcher before i found out if it was true apparently i was having a nightmare screaming morse code no no no not morse code thats spielberg at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons naps i was obviously paying too much attention even comatosei got pulled in at the start it turned out like any other mystery action movie all the clues and other attributes etc but there was so many thing that just are so idiotic that it pisses me off i have had so much tension on this from the book thinking it will be amazing but it all went away half way through the movie spoilers the part when she actually tries to make up the part of rape and when she puts wine on her skirt and whatever was so stupid what about the bloody cameras you idiots and if youre going to say she disabled them the what about the actual fake rape scene she sucked his dick and was wearing lingerie for gods sake who wears lingerie randomly if they looked at the cameras to watch the rape then what about the dick sucking and shirt tearing and pulling him in on you then pulling a knife out from under the pillow but what finished it for me was the ending what man like him in their own mind would stay with a murdering bitch like that and still love her this was my opinion you dont have to agree but i just found it so stupidi get the hype really linklaters before trilogy was fantastic i especially loved before midnight and people were justified in expecting great things from boyhood what i dont get are the numerous and nearly uniformly raving reviews this film has been getting from the critics and everyone else im utterly baffled by this critics are using words like masterpiece monumental profound and so on to describe this movie the film is currently sitting at #58 on imdbs top 250 all this praise is making me feel like a crazy person because i felt boyhood absolutely didnt deliver on the hype in fact the movie cant even be described as mediocre i feel like i need to make on thing clear here just because boyhood had the novel idea of shooting a film with the same actors during a long period of time doesnt grant it any automatic points a novel idea or approach may pique my interest and convince me to see a movie but thats as far as it goes we dont appreciate and enjoy movies simply because someone put some effort into them there has to actually be something there to justify spending our precious time and money to watch pixels on a screen for a couple of hours now lets jump into my gripes with the movie firstly boyhood has absolutely no distinct style it is a lifeless husk without form or anything resembling a cinematic look just like one other reviewer put it boyhood felt like watching a home movie about someone you dont know and dont care about i cant remember a single scene where i thought wow thats a neat shot or a moment where some cinematographic choice actually enhanced the scene that tells a lot about the cinematographic effort and choices that were put into this film bland and uninspired is to put it mildly the editing does the film no favors either right when something emotional or important could have happened the movie simply cuts to another scene and doesnt reference or deal with what happened previously in any way it all felt terribly directionless for example mason ellar coltrane gets bullied in a school bathroom okay great probably something many of us can identify with how did it get to this? how does he deal with it later on and how does it affect him? we simply dont know its a wholly detached scene with no meaning at one point theyre planting obama signs on peoples lawns great maybe theyre idealistic about the political system and theyd later revise their views or something? nope none of that is ever mentioned or dealt with in any way again most of the scenes are like this and go absolutely nowhere when the film actually goes back to something that was introduced earlier it feels extremely contrived like with the bit about masons mom advising a latino immigrant about going to school and how he later comes back to thank her for that encouragement really subtle guys there were a few scenes where i was slightly amused and that mostly about how awkward the scene was but mostly i was just constantly cringing at how bad the acting and the writing were i guess thats the risk you run into when you cast young actors and stay with them for twelve years  they might just not be that good at acting ellar coltrane seemed like hed had a shot of horse tranquilizer before every scene hes that apathetic and dull the characters have no real depth or character arcs and i didnt care or get attached to any of them masons philosophic rants were cringeworthy and uninteresting they also seem to come out of nowhere and therefore feel unearned at no point did i think that they really struck a chord with what it was like growing up during the 90s and the 2000s i was simply depressingly bored for most of the movie many have complimented this movie about being close to real life well thats debatable but that shouldnt be an automatic positive either watching paint dry and standing in the line in the grocery store is real life too i dont want to see banal mindlessness when i go to the movies but maybe thats just me a film this ambitious should really have something original to say instead it just wasted my timei found this movie to be overly long full of itself endlessly oppressive virtually humorless and overall not worth your time thats my summary but in order to add imdbs required 10 lines on the plus side it was well made so it does draw you in but the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch i eventually sat with my eyes closed so as not to continue to be bombarded by those scenes i didnt want to leave as i had gone with others and eventually covered my ears for the same reason the scenes may be beautifully shot but they are in the end very slow and boring this film should have been half the length and have added twice as much lightnessi found this film very disturbing and it was a waste of my time going to see the film i found that it took awhile to understand the story and there wasnt much of an introduction of the characters throughout the entire film i thought that johnny depp was better in the pirate of the caribbeans franchise overall the film was ok in some parts of the film can the makers of the film please make a better version of the movie and call it a different name and maybe if they put more work into it and had better scripts i would be more satisfied with the film i recommend this film to people who hate science fiction as it really brings out the weaknesses and errors that occurs in sciencei followed this series through the first season and kept thinking this guy stephen amellhas got to get better some how well that hasnt materialized i dont think stephen amell could make someone think he had to defaecate if he had a box of laxatives i i came across someone in real life with the emotion the characters display in this series im assume right away that they needed mental help its like people who didnt work out anywhere else all wound up here such a huge pool of bad talent and whats up with the mother and daughter do they have herpes? what the hell is on their lips?grossi dont usually give a 110 even for utter trash everything about this movie is a liepropaganda peasants love johnny depp and morgan freeman so the popular guys are playing the scientists rushing to replace humanitys future with an ai they control which will answer the deep mysteries of life just good guys with good intentions? right? look up ray kurzweil who is director of engineering at google there are mega rich people funding ai research and want to become gods or immortal when their personalities are uploaded onto the internet so will caster is a smug atheist who isnt working with government bulls*** and he is poisoned by a terrorist trying to save humanity o lets try and upload him into a computer not because he would love to be a god but because some terrorist killed him bulls*** basically transcedence is richest 1% getting overruling over the rest of us even after death the horrori dont understand why this movie has 85 imdb rating its pretty boring movie acting is pretty lame its not engaging at all basically if you are not under 13 youll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie i felt like im watching a live play act rather than a movie direction acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs ive seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers there are quite a few scenes where its so dark that you cant make anything out storyline is very short and not enough for a movie in the end it shows that they will be back next time or something i hope they dont as i wont be watching it at least not in the theater anyways waste of timei dont know why walt disney movies have become so dull and tasteless the story of cinderella is a great storybut the acting is simply terrible and the movie is so boring the story of

black hole and i dont understand why the black hole can flash i means though some energy can escape from the black hole but the visible light does not have the enough energy i guest there are other very obvious mistakes haha it is said that the hero gets in the 5d space let us make an example in 1d world the ant would be blocked by a spot however when the ant get into the 2d world the spot would not be the block anymore which means the block in lower dimension would not be the block anymore in a higher dimension thus if the hero gets in the 4d world i dont think he would be block in the black hole and he gets in the 5d world~~~~ hahai dont have a huge amount to say about this film as i feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours for those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film i have a question would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadnt watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? my personal answer is no and my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters im not denying the concept is brilliant and original however overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of pubertyi do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie i think that its hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it but there is nothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie it was terrible the story bordered on depressing the trailer leads one to believe that this is a documentary of a childs life but it is not there are actors in it it was awful just awful and i do hope it will not end up winning an oscar surely someone could do a coming of age movie better or a documentary set over 12 years better i wish i could understand what the reasoning behind the good reviews i watched the movie and i just cannot see iti do not know what kind of pr team the production team has hired to promote this film but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than inception seriously guys??? this film has 510 stars at best and even that for just potential rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it stupid illogical and at times really boring and long even though i am no scientist it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that i have no comments to this set your expectations low no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted herei didnt always vote on imdb but if my twocents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all i would however if you like a lousy crime thriller film wannabe this one is your very choice i am wondering why gone girl is getting a pretty good score here 84 huh? are you kidding me? are people not seeing that noticeably fat plot hole? i had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance the writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction he used many wrong imagination so what we got and paid for is this pieceofs i mean art gone girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her so compared to them she was real smart one day she thought shed set her cheating husband up for a murder so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion she drew out her blood threw it around the house then cleaned the house not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it luckily he didnt come home before she got away for her everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake as the film went on and on everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind this sounds very mary sue to me every cops in the writers world worked like an amateur they worked fast too fast but use no brains they didnt work the evidences or traced any phones they used only what she fed them fbi wouldnt do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped and then the cops let her husband drive her home still soaking in blood when i saw that scene i was going to fall apart thats it thats the whole story tell me she used some kind of dark magic that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this mary sues words regardless this movie was disappointingi decided to give this film a go out of a love for classic disney pre digital angelina jolies striking image and the fantasy element sadly angelina jolies image is the only successful aspect of this film what a surprise that is the only image associated with the film elle fanning is in the kindest terms distinctly average and certainly not blessed with grace or a beauty by any great stretch of the imagination neither can she act sharlto copley is also incredibly overrated and should only be considered for minor supporting roles there is no character development copleys character is shown as a love interest then we are told not shown that he is ambitious next thing he is evil and cuts off maleficents wings and becomes inherently bad  this makes no sense when maleficent finds her wings stolen we see her mourn for them for a few seconds at most next thing she is evil while the cgi is good the fairy fantasy element is shallow  remember how rich with emotion action humour and charm the animal scenes were in snow white and the seven dwarfs? i expected a certain amount of darkness and menace something to give us an emotional journey  this was completely lacking all in all a wasted opportunity of a film it would be forgettable if it didnt infuriate me so muchi created an imdb account because of this movie it is the worst dragged out boring try hard words i dont think exist garbage ive ever seen please give me my money and 3 hours of life back when im on my deathbed in 5060 hopeful years riddled with dementia and parkinsons divorced 8 times with kids who hate me and nothing but an unmarked grave to look forward to my biggest regret in life will no doubt be watching this film i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony 30 minutes in i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony strapped to a flaming 2 tonne anvil with a noose around my neck and 8 pounds of plastic c4 set to detonate on impact 1 hour in so on and so forth why did i finish watching you ask? well cause i was hoping pleading praying to the holy jesus lord above that this movie would get better maybe have an exciting plot twist maybe just maybe not continue being a dreadfully boring and inconceivably lame story of a teenager and his regular as f**k life and then what boom? its over? at least give me a micheal bay explosion on that bland cliff hes sitting on thats it im done not wasting anymore time on this horrible boring waste of my according to this film thrilling life tips for watching this movie step 1 wait for it to come out on dvd step 2 take out massive loan from bank step 3 buy all the copies you can of this movie step 4 put all copies through wood chipper step 5 burn with fire step 6 cry tears of joy for being a superhero step 7 weep tears of sorrow for all those who find this movie deserves ten stars for i cant begin to imagine the excitement of a day in their livesi couldnt rate any lower than 1 so i guess it gets a 1 how on earth does this stuff get green lit? i dont understand this type of movie may have been good in 1981 but in 2014 there is no excuse the plot is completely ludicrous the dialogue is horrible i think hes fragmented seriously? i found myself bursting out with laughter at the ridiculousness of the entire movie how many eye rolling minutes can you pack into a movie? id rather watch paint dry complete and utter failure i love movies i love when i watch a movie and i am reminded why i love movies it will take 23 good movies to get over the sour taste this movie left in my mouth avoid at all costs do not give them a reason to even consider making something else along these linesi could not have believed quite how bad interstellar is it is truly dreadful after six months travelling with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole the token blackman speaks to the hero who has his suntan intact massa massa what is going on? the hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole if he didnt know this wtf was he doing on the trip? their understanding of relativity is at the level id expect from my goldfish they give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from earth  for some reason in b&w the hero goes through as dorothy parker said all the emotions from a to b they claim it is a post colonial world but the space suits all have the us flag on them the spaceship controls are circia 1960 poor michael cain is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? to be fair it is unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless avoid this film if you possibly cani checked the spoiler box just in case but nothing happens nothing to spoil huge waste of time everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies but i would highly recommend to stay away from boyhood this movie is terrible it is filmed over a twelve year period yes twelve same actors and actresses the movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours2 hours of my life i will never get back i love all kinds of movies action adventure drama comedy even a chick flick now and then but this movie went nowhere did nothing and ended up like every other person in life see it for yourself but you have been warned cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crapi cant believe they wasted one of the best tv shows ever simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric tom cruise and i cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes topgun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in hollywood these days sigh and what is there to think about in this movie?? tom cruise in starting frame tom cruise gets double teamed tom cruise gets mad tom cruise gets teary eyed tom cruise exclaims constantly did you order the code red tom cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train tom cruise saves the day tom cruise in last frame has any tom cruise movie been any different?? i wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inchessigh would have made my dayi cant believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? like all of nolans other movies interstell im not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion there was nothing even remotely good about this film it attempted to blend ideas and plots from past scifi films but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characterscheesy and awkward dialog to the story or lack thereof made this film unwatchable the characters did not come off like scientists they didnt even come off like people in such dire situations would such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole anne hathaways character was particularly inferior i seriously wanted someone to strangle her of course this could have been excused if the movie didnt take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualitiesaspects however the film tries so hard to be profound but it ends up being awkward the endi cannot understand how such a capable cast could make such a dog of a movie didnt they read the script before they accepted the roles? the premise of the film is stupid and as such assumes people are stupid add this to the ponderous and boring pace of the movie a bunch of uninteresting characters who are impossible to relate to and a totally predictable and contrived ending on it and you have all the ingredients of a hollywood trainwreck the dvd was described as action this is false advertising what little action there is is about as exciting as watching paint dry the copy i rented had the worst case of bad sound really soft dialogue contrasted with action sounds that almost took the back wall out of my lounge room if i werent so bored maybe i wouldnt have noticed im really glad i didnt pay more than an overnight rental on this but really wish i could have the 2 or so hours of my life i wasted watching this rubbish backi cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich_ that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmai cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmai cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable the plot is very obvious even the ending without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense unfortunately this did not happen maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digitsi can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie i actually got up and walked out halfway through there was so much gratuitous violence that i couldnt stand it splattering blood everywhere in order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but i will try and keep them to a minimum so if you want to be surprised dont read any further but i wouldnt be surprised if i were you we were and i am still angry about it i will say that several of the cast members were very good the premise of the movie is juvenile 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half this gimmick was repeated later in the movie samuel jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like flava flav and serves mcdonalds to who he thinks is a billionaire donor seriously? then there was the whole shoot the dog bit really how original but when everyone started killing each other in the church i was done if you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley i went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad i made the decision to leave the movie how many times to you blow up a persons head and call it entertainment? it really bothers me that some people find this entertaining this was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parodyhomage to james bond also am i the only one who got the subliminal message with the obama look alike who gets killed? seriously? there are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie if you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will noti came here to check the reviews and i was mislead so here i am hoping that people will see this and not bother first thing that you notice is the bad actingpersonal opinion and man that is annoying the show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring so unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind im gonna have to stop watching this show if you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but dont expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there i know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in imdb i always come here to check some of them this show is overrated and doesnt deserve the reviews in herei bought the studio hype that this was the most intelligent sicfi film since 2001 space odyssey what an insult to kubrick like the dark knight rise interstellar is 3 long hours of torture from the moment mccanaughey accidentally stumbles upon nasas gigantic secret launch operation  just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from him and they never noticed and by the way as long as youre here could you pilot the mission? we just never had any plans for a pilot until you barged in christ this is a plot device from gilligans island the rest of this turkey might be summed up as weepy soap opera in outer space too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an intelligent sicfi film anne hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a seasoned astronaut and like dark knight the plot is so convoluted that i eventually gave up caring the final scenes perhaps somewhat inspired by 2001 are lame and pretentious id rather be waterboarded than suffer through nolans dreck again im giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 910 star reviews no wonder american film has gone downhill when the audiences mistake a pretentious poorly written fruit pie for the masterpiece of a geniusi am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is scifi basically if the sicfi component  most of which does not really happen until the end  is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic hollywood soap opera the wornout rag of clich family relations all americandad complicated love affair unruly and a classic tomboygirl coworkers more like coidiots who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally you know to up the ante it really makes up 90% of this movie up until half way trough i honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director there are also very obvious holes in the plot and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sicfi movies at least try to amend somehow i can not help but think that after watching automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump it is literally that bad what saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending so just watch that instead because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of santa barbara spolers about ridiculous plot holes as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough 1 the stupid dust bowl recycled seriously? i am not even going to try to explain this because id need to repost have of wikipedia here but it does not work that way not in the past  not in the future 2 the moment nasa abducts the main character and daughter and questions them seriously? maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3 nasas facility is top secret right in the age supposedly after the present when there are drones and google maps they manage to hide a huge facility in some old james bond villain fashion 4 lets go to another galaxy ok if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket carrying a futuristic shuttle why for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there  instead of looking in our own? what they really expected to have better luck there  than in our own? they already searched the entire milky way? and whats even better  it just so happens there is a planet like a stones throw away from the black hole and is not being consumed by it and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything but a collapsed star? why lets just start diving down toilets because you know they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions like dimensions of dementia perhaps 5 saving the best for last  i did like the ending despite its absurdity i did like it almost cried  if i were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology but i digress the machine that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future past is built by the very humanity he is trying to save that survived and built the machine in the future lord have mercy i will try to explain this so basically if we consider all major theories about time travel in order to change the future one must go there and change it right? but here the future changes the past and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed futures help mind >>> blowni am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely

people will figure out their mistake lets face it the plot is ridiculous working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like weve seen them before but we dont really remember where from well maybe another movie like the collector nova prime or korath and many many clich_s but the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes i couldnt laugh even once and i do tend to have a good sense of humor the joke about slipping the finger on your neck  really? and rocket demanding a mans artificial leg for nothing to say later that that was a joke  absolutely unnecessary on top of its nonsense the final scene ronan is about to finally get his revenge has the power to do so is about to do so then at the very last moment he stops to watch quill dancing while others prepare to blast him oh forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire the one driving my whole life and existence lets just stop and watch him dance seriously? was that supposed to be funny? am i a tenyearold boy watching woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene what a great plot indeed maybe i could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain with lights and sound but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children one very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful cgi images not all but many specially those from space and star warslike spaceship battles every single other marvel movie was better than this  and not all were exactly good if the sequence is going to be as good as the first one please dont even start it marvel and not to forget some one has to tell nasa that to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves awesomei am so disappointed in this movie the ratings gave me high expectations for this movie but i feel really let down this movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of growing up and going through life it is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as real as possible but this is not reality reality has more emotion more struggle more comedy and more life life is not an objective biography or recollection of events it is a subjective frenzy i can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive tldr this movie about life is more boring than life itselfi am sick and tired of hollywoods inaccuracies in the films they produce from amistads horrendous lies about its stories of slavery to tyler perry making me believe that he is an actual elderly black woman hollywood keeps pooping out new flicks that focus entirely on the entertainment and not at all on the facts and its safe to say that boyhood was the worst of all this movie made me so livid that i wanted to cut my freaking cats ear off the film portrayed a boy as he grew from five to seventeen years old in front of the audiences eyes he lived in a mostly happy household with only a few minor obstacles but nothing too severe that the family couldnt handle it except that one part the people who have viewed the film will know what part i mean boyhood did not represent childhood in a realistic way and it especially did not represent my childhood i was born in a small town in nebraska on the dance floor of a strip club off the interstate where my mom happened to be dancing that night many people took their dollars back off the stage the moment i popped out i emerged from my mothers uterus with a feeling of ambition a feeling that i could take the world by storm however my father a flight attendant had other plans for me once i got my basic motor movements down he had me training to be just like your old man as he put it pops made me train for hours on end serving drinks and peanuts to family friends and relatives while always keeping a phony smile on my face by the age of three i knew the safety procedure speech like the back of my hand and keep in mind this was before i even knew the alphabet or my own name all i ever wanted to do was juggle for a living i once told him about my desire to attend juggling camp for a week over the summer he replied by saying i bet youd like to handle all those balls wouldnt you? stick to flight attending son its a mans job i was devastated the idea of being able to keep more than one ball in the air at a time mesmerized me for years to come but i could never make my dreams known for fear of what my father might do once i graduated from high school my dad pulled some strings and got me a job as a flight attendant at the nearest airport he had retired at this point he said he did it because 911 really sucked balls he was so excited that i was following or should i say flying in his footsteps but the day i was supposed to start the job i did not make it to the airport for i was on my way to follow my dreams i hit the open road looking for the nearest juggling college the existential feeling of bliss that i felt from the freedom of being out of my fathers control was more than i had ever felt before but it quickly diminished for i learned that there is no such thing as juggling college amateur mistake blake amateur mistake i ran out of money fast having spent it all on an expensive juggling set i had planned on showing off to all the other kids at juggling college so that i could be one of the cool kids i hooked for a little bit but no one would take my body i have a bad hunching problem and a massive rash on my back so it kind of looks like molten lava rushing down the side of a volcano when i take my shirt off i had nowhere to go no one to turn to for many a days i ate garbage from a dumpster behind burger king which i know sounds redundant since their food is already garbage i got food poisoning thrice over the course of a year reluctantly i knew what i had to do i tucked my tail in between my legs and made the long journey home back to my parents i knocked on the door and asked my dad for forgiveness no son of mine will be a juggler not on my watch he yelled but dad i pleaded you are forever shunned from this household he said with an icy look then he slammed the door in my weary face i am still homeless i have no money and nowhere to go i recently beat a man with one of my expensive juggling pins in a fight over a box of raisin bran its brutal out there let me tell you i figured out this family was going on vacation for a couple weeks so i am currently squatting in their home i came to see boyhood because i rented it on their credit card and i am also stealing their internet to write this review i just needed to get my thoughts on how unrealistic boyhood was out in the open because i checked and i didnt see anyone else complaining about this i mean cmon hollywood where was the part about flight attendants? where were the parts about the boys love for juggling and his dads denial of any pursuit of the boys dreams? huh????? because tell me if im wrong but i didnt catch those parts it really baffles me how well you hollywood bigwigs botched this great idea for a movie call me when you make a good movie for once im done with this bs ps dont call me because i dont own a phone because im homeless because my dad shunned me for my love of juggling sincerely your fellow imdb user blakelogsdon1i am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here as i found it a huge disappointment absolutely nothing about it makes any sense in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier the science is ridiculous a sixinch deep ocean with 200foot waves is one of the more believable elements the motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision the special effects are unimaginative kubrick did it all better without cgi 50 years ago the bombastic musics only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue and the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical involving manually transmitting what must be many many gigabytes of data in morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch wt*? definitely not recommendedi am not a huge fan of blockbusters so maybe i am not the target audience of this movie but i do enjoy them from time to time but this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies i have seen in cinemas granted i have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years it reminded me of another movie which i consider as one of my least favourite movies wanted to be honest there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one the first problem was maybe colin firth i thought he was so incredibly miscast it seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs he was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful even in comparison those movies at least seem more original many of the characters reminded me of many older movies the same old rough kid being trained to fight story has been done over and over again the whole banter between the posh guys and eggsy is cringeworthy the lead actor who played the role of eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable he really doesnt have the look for such a role i guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny but most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat what was the point of the head explosions? that was absolutely the worst scene that i have seen in cinemas in recent years i expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me the church fight was also stupid and meaningless just meaningless violence but without the beauty of john woo or even movies like the matrix the whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys i am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes maybe that last one in the end and another thing that i disliked was the use of classic rock music like freebird it seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe now lastly the presence of samuel jackson didnt really elevate the movie much he does better than the other actors but as far as i can remember he doesnt really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie but i am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and i was able to finish it there are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions which have been done more realistically by tom savini in low budget 80s movies church fights and so on i know my rating is a little harsh since samuel jackson is not so bad but i am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned 310i am a bit of a cinema buff and i have seen quite a few efforts from all over the world dating back to the very dawn of the art form this is worst film i have ever seen  it looked like an amateur home video to me except it was much much much much much longer too absurd and stupid to be really boring however this pseudo intellectual psychological stink bomb probably is held in awe by lovers of star wars and starbucks coffee the only fun i had while watching this disaster was trying to guess how it would end well i also had fun laughing at how badly written this movie was so i suppose in that sense i have to admit it was enjoyable to participate in this flaccid collapsing 911 of cinema i kept asking my girl friend when will this end? a few times i thought they were ready to pull the plug but no  like dracula it seemed to have eternal life it kind of just petered out one day and i think that maybe they just ran out of money or someone pounded a stake through the plastic kodak fixed focus they were using as a camera they certainly didnt run out of ideas because there were none to be found i am really astounded at how amateurish this piece of garbage was sorry i really cant do a more thoughtful profound review of this mess  my brain just wont do iti always liked sifi movies the alien saga 2001 space odyssey gravity and even star wars of course they invite you to dream about extraterrestrial creatures exploration of the cosmos interstellar fights and what might be like living beyond the earth well interstellar falls very short at that why? simply because it goes well beyond what it is possible and lets keep it clear i am stating that in a bad sense after nasas orion struggles on building a shuttle to send humans to asteroids and even mars for the sake of what? interstellar illustrates us how to even get into black holes scape out of them and see your own daughter dying while you still have more energy and time to keep procreating what is next? it is a shame that a gang can keep you nearly three hours while getting your money to brief you about real science and the new fifth dimension with which that you can communicate through the 3d space and time bad bad and badhow disney could take a classic story involving a wonderfully evil character and make her into a victim of male abuse is beyond me its a terribly misguided attempt to influence our daughters to mistrust and find fault with men even the wonderful fairies in the original story who saved protected provided love and a good upbringing for snow white have those outstanding feminine qualities taken away from them they are reduced to bumbling caretakers who watch over her until maleficent finds her and eventually becomes her benefactor i dont think we as a society should try to right a wrong with another wrong if the powerful women in hollywood think that hollywood produces movies that portray women in less than desirable ways there is no reason to counter attack with this awful story aimed at the impressionable psyche of our children if you have concerns about your daughters and sons viewing a story about abusive men and psychologically damaged women getting revenge stay away from this movie let children have their childhood and take them to movies that are age appropriatehow can anyone give this film 1010 ? it lasts for 3 hours and for the first hour nothing happens they could have condensed the first hour to 10 minutes poor plot nasa developing a secret base because the public would not support spending on such expensive waste of money err maybe they would have spotted the dirty great big rocket launching and wonder what it was ?? how about picking the most ridiculous planet that orbits a black hole? you would never be able to develop and further space as anything in orbit had 7 years for every hour on the surface that stupid puddle planet  and the statement that the explorer had just arrived in their time due to relativity ?? err it took 2 years for them to get to jupiter where the wormhole was so assuming they did not leave until they reported back they would have been on the surface for 2 years why cant the transmit back real information  i may have missed that when they can send video messages ? sending back fake data about a planet that is frozen and has ammonia i the air so that it looks good is lame as hell you picked someone to go on a mission through a wormhole alone but they crumble about dying on a frozen planet is stupid anyway you could spot what the planet was like from a long long way to know it was fake hmm turning the robot into a bomb that self destructs ? why ? could they not spot when they landed it was fake? ie a frozen landscape for miles around is not what i would have called a viable planet ahh yes and sending messages back through the wormhole using gravity to encode data in the watch ticking using morse code ????? pathetic i had no joy watching this film except when it went off science fiction this is nothis 4th dud in a row a ridiculous plot for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn so no animals birds or fish even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground never mind lets move on once again nolans characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away just one example of quite fewthe biggest plot hole is this for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space he becomes super intelligient because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind how he knows this we do not know given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever now to the film making others have mentioned its look  well to me it looked shabby endless shots of aircraft wings no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close in fact thank god i did not see this in imax would have been a complete waste of time and now the noise with hans zimmers worst and most bombastic score  added onto very loud sound effects with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches the end did not make any sense at all but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsoverheres the bottom line i think there should be an exception for these imdb reviews considering theres really nothing of absolute revelation or a spectacular climax everything you thought of going on in an ordinary persons life that could happen happens thats it again this isnt a spoiler you already knew what happens in this movie before even seeing the trailers trust me youre not missing anything stay home and watch videos of your own family through the years youll be happy you did i will add that if ethan hawke wins the oscar for supporting actor i wouldnt have a problem with it he did do a good job at the rolehaving built high expectations from an almost 10 out of 10 imdb rating and portrayed as a great spy thriller in the reviews we went to watch the movie but were extremely and totally disappointed and disgusted with everything in the movie the storyline and direction were aimless and weak the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality james bond type weaponry tricks and style the movies plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a james bond type movie instead anyway such movies always get made but what i am most disappointed about is the fact that the imdb reviews & ratings were completely rigged imdb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process my suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on tv for a free time passhated it most boring film of the year couldve followed someone a bit interesting for ten years rather than this boring tripe sit around the kitchen table go to school kitchen table school father in law gets drunk school table etc etc you get the idea thats it in a nutshell sorry for all the spoilers but turkey of the year for me do not understand how so many people like it probably many boring people relate to it hope it doesnt win any oscars there are many other films more worthy just because this is a unique film doesnt make it a good one acting is terrible and there is no plot obviously its just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced but are still friends but im struggling to see the story here surely if you are going to do something as clever as is at least make it worthwhile most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident this kid doesnt nowt didnt even have a personalityhard to sit through and terribly misleading its a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters commemorating death advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress and portraying mass murder as a cool action scene the first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film easy to compare to the bond films however as the movie progressed the entire validity of the characters morals were flushed down the drain i and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film the trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement i stress please watch at your own discretionhahahahhahahah this is the most original thing ive seen in the past years if only it were a comedyparody  thinking of it actually its funnier this way so nvm the comedyparody statement before i go on i have to say that ive never read green arrow but this is not the case here at all why its funny? for starters look at the review title this series is actually a soap opera everything about it is well with the exception that green arrow stars in it the directing is horrid so is the acting and the character lines the story looks ok and id really like to know how it unravels theres also hot women in it not something one wouldnt expect those last two facts are not enough for one to sit and watch it but theyre the reason why i rated with 310 and not 110 what i will do i propose you do the same is start reading the green arrow comic books and google for hot women instead of wasting my time watching this thing it was really fun hilarious tbh watching the first couple of episodes might be three cant recall but enough is enough nextguardians of the galaxy is just another mediocre film under the pretence of future it sneaked in embraces of the past perhaps it tried to be both but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy it failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me its humour was out of context there were too many characters most of which were not properly developed the purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing ill comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs someone commented that the films like the dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful that person further commented that this film guardians of the galaxy challenged this standard i generally dont like dogmas but here its not at all about dogmas it is just the fact that those deep ones could trigger deeper emotions or provoke thoughts or inspire the audiences or help the audiences learn something or help the audiences learn themselves better by these the audiences like think about involuntarily recall remember and give high scores for those deep films of course different people have different opinions on deepness so i dont comment on the deepness of guardians of the galaxy just commenting on triggering deeper emotions or provoking thoughts or inspiring me or helping me learn something or learn myself better unfortunately guardians of the galaxy did none of these to me so it just didnt make me feel that way that it was one of those alltime great films someone commented that guardians of the galaxy was not a serious film but rather it was a great lighthearted comedy even for this i dont think i could agree great humour exists in context in the right context something plain could be hilarious out of context brilliant jokes were just nothing in guardians of the galaxy too much humour ran out of context for example the raccoon said later that he asked for one prisoners prosthetic leg was just a joke what did this convey? it was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? no how about it tried to portray a figure the raccoon who was unfazed in front of great danger? but then you had to make the situation look dangerous even in the wizard of oz 1939 the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison the prison here felt just like a noisy secondhand market so i didnt find the joke funny and didnt know why it was in the film otherwise either there were many such lines i knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh but i just didnt feel that entertained at those improper moments all in all guardians of the galaxy has no place on the alltime great list perhaps it was the last joke it could play on itself being put into the top 250 list among those great films its mediocrity would just manifest itself just within the first month of its release it dropped 20 places on the top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th as time goes on this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge there are great films like in the name of the father 1993 a beautiful mind 2001 etc they were not on the top 250 list before but gradually rose up and emerged into the alltime great list just on the contrary guardians of the galaxy will gradually drop out of the top 250 listguardians of the galaxy is a new low for marvel and for the comic book sub genre in general no one was clamoring for a movie to be made from the comic book that almost no one had even heard of however because of the marvel brand and the stunning visuals and action sequences this became one of the highest grossing films of the year the film is no more than a cash grab and a stepping stone in setting up the second avengers the characters are trite and obvious and the villain i cant remember his name for the life of me could not have been more inconsequential or underdeveloped groot was the only part of the movie besides the visuals that was mildly interesting the story is ridiculous as well as the setting this movie has a higher rating on imdb than some of the best films of the year including foxcatcher the grand budapest hotel and the theory of everythingguardians of the galaxy has a great 70s soundtrack which is recommended to be listened to on your walkman while on your own adventures rather than as the score to this latest piece of hollywood marvel trash but that doesnt make up for a crap film with a pathetic childish storyline bs joke acting and zero suspense worse than that  it wasted karen gillan who is one of the hottest scifi girls on the planet and can act a whole better than the dumb talentless yanks she has the misfortune to share her pathetic amount of screen time with besides karen who is always fun the only character in this piece of juvenile junk with any charisma is a wooden tree voiced by vin diesel the rest is a total garbage film for the under 5s or idiots to enjoyguardians of the craplaxy its been a while since i gave a comment about movies

it ever watched and americans line up like sheep to see it this film along with other blockbusters like the grinch make me ashamed of our film industrymaybe these films are why the french hate us so much hmmmmm some bozo script writer has the wonderful idea to make the bad guy jim phelps he or she remembers hearing the name somewhere and it has a nice ring to it it should you idiothe was the hero from the original series that everyone loved while youre at it why not remake some other old tv shows that feature barney the dinosaur as a child molester or santa claus as an alcoholic? ahhhhhhhh then after irritating all the old fans lets create the dumbest special effects ever and base the entire movie around explosions and stuntseven though the original series used these very sparingly my favorite example was the banal chase sequence there we see the macho tom cruise riding the skids of a helicopter suddenly it blows up and he blasts forward onto the train he is pursuing and lands expertly on the train if this were really attempted it would cost the lives of 67000000 stunt men to get this stunt right providing that the laws of physics no longer applied during the duration of the stunt then because this was such a cool stunt other pictures included very similar stunts for the next year or so i was half expecting to see it in the next elmo movie america wake upstop attending mindnumbing megabudget movies just because they are marketed to us at every turn pssince i first posted this review tom cruises stupid public statements make me wish i could rank the movie lower than a 1man i am getting sick of seeing this guygreat characters intricate plots and an ensemble cast helped define the original mission impossible during the 1960s but the elements that made the original series so strong are all but lost in this first big screen effort it all starts out promising enough when we join the imf in the middle of a mission unfortunatley once the team members are systematically eliminated one by one we leave mission impossible behind and instead stumble into a high tech version of the fugitive with tom cruise again playing himself as he so often has in so many of his films this is a shame considering the strong supporting cast and the potential it had to be an intelligent and intriguing update of the original series the original concept and characters are betrayed by the writers and director brian depalma easy to follow and sit through but ultimately disappointing lets hope they get it right for the sequelgone girl psychopaths and woman beaters the first segment in the movie shows nick and amy dunnes marriage played by ben affleck and rosamund pike one day amy mysteriously disappears all attention is on nick as his reactions to the disappearing of his wife are distant and unsettling after nick is almost proved guilty it is revealed that amy planted all of the evidence in an attempt to get revenge on her husband we were all on her side at this point amys diary revealed that nick had beaten and sexually abused her as well as used all of her savings on senseless buys and then the film completely lost me amy reveals she faked the entire thing nick was not an abuser it is further understood amy has a history of making false rape accusations and more the film makes you sympathize with nick as he has become a victim of a psychopathic wife however nick still remains an incredibly unlikeable character who was taking advantage of a 20yearold amy then returns to her dissatisfied husband at this point i had completely given up on the film and was just waiting to see nick leave his psychopathic wife of course that wont happen instead the film ends with nick being trapped with amy after she confesses that she stole his sperm and impregnated herself gone girl had great potential but its plot twists ruined the film the acting was decent but the direction completely blurred the message if there even was a message at times even the actors looked like they couldnt believe how terrible the film was ultimately gone girl was unsatisfying and deeply disturbing but not in a good way the film tried way too hard to shock the audience but simply left us confused and deeply regretting ever even watching it gone girl was simply a huge waste of two hoursgone girl is based on a rather absurd premise a careful psychotic plot to frame somebody for your own murder this type of idea is clearly deranged but hopefully it does not cross too many peoples mind the idea was developed much better in the great noir film leave her to heaven where the framing was done in a slightly more subtle way but we do not live in subtle times so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence even if this would be a spoiler for the few who still do not know the plot the story revolves around unhappy couple amy and nick ben affleck woody and expressionless as usual is creepy nick the unfaithful husband who for half an hour is the main suspect for the disappearance of amy beautiful rosamund pike is psycho crazy wife amy a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws she manipulates every man she meets and at the end of the movie even police detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said amys plotting is given away much too soon in the movie so we spend two very long hours just following the demented blonde around and nick getting in big trouble only for amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed does it make much sense? apparently yes since critics and lots of imdb users loved itgod this show just doesnt get better when i saw the imdb ratings i thought i should give the show a try i mean it had an 8+ on imdb and i dont typically watch anything below 7 alright so apparently the show must be for someone else than me because after starting to watch it nothing justifies the good scores okay so i kept going hoping that i was missing something  or maybe the good stuff just came later? but im now in the middle of season 3 and i have never wasted as much time as i have watching arrow who wrote *read stole* that plot? its not even stolen very well as it is obviously much much worse than any similar vigilante plots out there and you just after a few shows you will know exactly what will happen next and think to yourself no they wouldnt say that or do this cause that would just be dumb unoriginal and lame and then bum it happens and you get so embarrassed for the director honestly more than half of the episode i had to look away of embarrassment god i really dont understand how this show could get more than 55 at maximum so heres the main points  incredibly bad acting  plot is stolen directly from other novels & movies such as for instance batman  hell even ras al guhl is in it which is a monstrous disgrace  editing mediocre  not even the action scenes are good  no original bad guys either  what does it do good? well i guess i think i saw a lamborghini aventador somewhere in season 2 alright 2 stars  1 for the lambo and the other for the ability to fool such a large audience and somehow make it this far without being a total flop beyond my mind to figure out stay away dont waste your hours this show isnt even good for a rainy day unless youve already watched everything else there is to watch and even then id consider doing something else thats more exciting and less predictable  such as playing chessgo colonize mars instead what was the point of the mission? to save humanity how? by evacuating all of earth on huge space stations to another planet accessible through a black hole near saturn and you need to gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to do it 1 direct trip from earth to saturn = 8 round trips from earth to mars so go colonize mars instead also the robot design was very impractical ps who colonizeslands on a planet with a 1 hour = 7 years outside time anomaly? pointless suicidefor the life of me i cannot understand how this movie has received an 88 rating nor can i understand mathew mcconaughey he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick texas drawl that english sub tittles are required not that he has anything interesting to say nor do any of the other characters for that matter so lets have a look at the plot the world has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers the only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation however everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling suvs is there something wrong with this picture? in the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet however a worm hole has been located somewhere near saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race so this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on earth etc and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion i had lost interest the visual effects arent all that special seen it all before in fact i think the effects in 2001 aso which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision in conclusion then a plot holier than a month of sundays a leading man to whom english is a second language nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 88? i dont think sofirstly i need to say that i have mixed feelings about the director richard linklater and his movies i like his movies but i dont like his style i follow his movies but i dont particularly enjoy his way of storytelling if i consider his filmography briefly i liked his debut before sunrise it was a warm nice romance film even if it didnt meet my expectations fully i met a different film than the film in my mind however i called before sunset a masterpiece it was my movie unfortunately before midnight was a mind numbing experience for me because there was nothing but dialogs no cinema no art no drama we rather listened a story than watching a movie people talk talk and talk but mostly empty conversations not something which pushes audiences to think finally yesterday i saw boyhood and it was not a tiresome journey like before midnight thank goodness but again there was only a story without any background or even subtext if the message was life is empty then i swallow my words but i dont think so the movie consists of the daily routines of a boy and his family but the movie has not any real theme or has not anything to say to us i mean it has not come to any point other than very basic and naive things mr linklater cant catch even remarkable snapshots as he cant create remarkable moments during this almost three hours long movie i appreciate the movie only for its shooting technique which is a milestone for sure and it requires great devotion and great labor in the movie there are ceremonies cerebrations diners etc but there is no depth at all no point and of course no art the boys inner world his feelings his thoughts his soul none of those is showed or reflected by the director which is really pathetic the director never lets us deduce something this is not a growing up story this is not a movie about puberty crisis so what is the point? and the other main problem of the movie is that the boy including his family dont face with a real crisis or trouble or a problem and i know why because the director is too optimistic about life for example the biggest challenge in the boys life is presented as having a falling out with his girlfriend or moving out the boys sister supposedly stands for the flighty girls of today but it goes nowhere we are expected to feel sorry for the family when they have financial difficulty but personally i didnt because in the following scene we watch that the mother gives a splendid thanksgiving dinner to a bunch of people i think mr linklater hasnt seen bicycle thieves yet because otherwise he would have known struggling for life and being a kid in a world full of trouble this should have been a depressing movie in fact commonly it is said that this is a depressing movie but i believe just the opposite i had expected a depressing and realistic movie from boyhood as i had expected a moving and beautiful art film from before midnight or as i had expected seeing hardships of love relationships from before sunrise and dont expect an intense finale i did because life is bittersweetfirst this movie is a remake of an old series and secondly it has tom cruise in it tom cruise is not a bad actor it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him as if he were god no wonder the germans hated this movie anyway i will give away the plot in this movie because i feel that you really dont need to see it the only reason i taped it and watched it was because jean reno was in it and he is quite a good actor tom cruise is ethan hunt the member of the imf team that performs impossible missions during a routine mission everything goes wrong and only hunt and the wife of jim phelps the leader of the team escape the american government believe that hunt is behind it and is a mole selling out to the enemy so order him arrested but he manages to slip through their fingers and even breaks into cia headquarters at langley virginia it ends up that jim phelps is the mole and that jean reno is the agent who is in it for the money the movie ends in a scene in the english channel tunnel where reno flies a helicopter through it and hunt tackles phelps on the back of a train this movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed this is not an action packed movie but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series it is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it as such it follows the style of sneakers which i believe is a far superior moviefirst the good kenneth branagh does it again diversity in hollywood i loved seeing all of the people of non white heritage spattered about the landscape as if they all belonged there coodles to mr branagh for always thinking outside the white box now the bad the movie itself this was the most boring thing i ever sat through and i think that everyone in the small audience i was in on discount day thought the same anytime people leave a theater without saying a word its bad the dialog was the worst ive ever heard lily james is also the worst actress ive ever seen the saving grace was derek jacobi as the king his relationship with his son was far more interesting than cinderellas relationship with her entire family then there was the endless narration doesnt branagh know that the first rule of storytelling is show me dont tell me i guess he forgot in this film the landscapes were pretty but i got tired of the endless stream of colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom then there was the endless message of the film yes its a good message but a good message doesnt make up for a bad film as i quoted skip this and see ever after is was so much better at telling the cinderella storyfilm adaptations of beloved tv shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds the untouchables the fugitive charlies angels from the lumps of coal pretty much everything else given that brian depalma is the guiding force behind the untouchables and the very structure of the tv show mission impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget a talented cast and the big screen one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind unfortunately the end result is roughly 12 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium there is a lot of blame to go around for the end result which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels so far but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyones lists of favorite summer blockbusters first the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting for some reason known only to the screenwriters the focal character is someone completely new while the jim phelps character who led the tv series is shunted into support the film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the imf team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor naturally the powers that be assume the traitor is the lone survivor tom cruise but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee emmanuelle beart so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose himher or some such thing like the tv show there are a few twists and turns doublecrosses and reversals unlike the tv show none of them are particularly surprising or involving the cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched lead cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role but gives us no good reason to root for his character he spends much of the film either blankfaced or glowering beart as his cohort and potential love interest is lovely but listless jon voight takes on the jim phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull autopilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years jean reno is wasted as a later addition to cruises team while ving rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating henry czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in clear and present danger meanwhile more discerning viewers wait for the fartoobrief appearances of vanessa redgrave who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison depalma once known for some incredible set pieces provides the film with stillborn pacing he ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building unfortunately the scene goes on and on and on and on ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed these elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potentialeven though this movie had plenty of expensive glitter an excess of onscreen whispering coupled with an excess of flashbacks rendered the plot next to impossible to figure out but then again maybe that was the producers point to get us to return again and again until we have it all sorted out therefore i also give it 1 pointeven though it suppose to be based on the 1966 tv series anyone who has followed or really liked the television show will be disappointed because it doesnt have 4 guys but 1 as though the creators of this movie version has decided to interwine james bond solo idea into it so all you see throughout the movie is tom cruise being in the highlighted so much that you get the impression that maybe they should of made top gun 1996 movie instead i dont like when movie creators dont honor and adhere to original tv or movie concepts as it seems spitefully disrespectful as if they are saying i have a better idea i wont see anymore mission impossible movies as a result of this its like the green hornet 2011 movie that ruins a good concept by hijacking it totally somewhere elseengland is alternate universe america no further proof than this movie the kingspeople british people dress like americans they just talk funny and use a class system this movie is about the british class system and how even poor people are worthy to become pawns in some meaningless struggle between global economies also a lady offers analsex as an incentive for her rescue from imprisonment cause thats what women so often do in real life there are so many other choices to offer than anal sex right off the bat a handjob a blowjob just regular old vaginal sex when did vaginal sex become not good enough? is this a new thing? i mean you are just giving away the keys to the kingdom to like the first dude that comes along does that sound prudent to you? more entertaining than the following movies sleepers divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood for the love of the game chicagoego centered and senseless movie brian depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the tom cruise star has faded if you love tom and he can deserve your love just doesnt this time youll like the fact that for a team movie there is no team its all just tom thats fine if you dont remember the original concept of the cool tv show and lets face it the makers of the film were betting you dont best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots dangling wire scene is a steal fro topkakiwhich for depalma is a signature moment what can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments here though he really gets to do very little he certainly was taking the job hoping and getting a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal hitchcock rip off films  dont get me stated anyway he doesnt get to work much style into mission final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing cgi action scenes that have followed and dominated american movie making i dont mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script written and rewritten while they were shooting doesnt not hold together leaving cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a isnt this fun? dont take it too seriously attitude that might have saved at least him the film was a hit feel free not to listen to me or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is for those who see brian depalmas cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from topkaki unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme musicthat moment leads into the topkaki riff if you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch id say watch this one otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescuedr will caster johnny depp develops a sentient computer device with unsurpassed processing power when fatally poisoned by a radical technoterrorist organisation he and his wife rebecca hall upload his consciousness into his invention to preserve his life but the now unrestrained supercomputer soon develops a frightening ambition that blurs the line between humanity and technology it seems that every few years somebody in hollywood tries to redo the lawnmower man which is by no means a perfect movie especially with its laughable early generation cgi but it harbours an interesting premise what happens if we ignore our own judgement and let our technology get the better of us? its an old scifi trope going back decades that has definitely become a crutch of story telling to some extent but any good idea is worth exploring again and with such an impressive cast and a very promising production team behind it hopes were high for transcendence to be a good movie unfortunately though it isnt transcendence is a turgid lifeless bore of a film that doesnt really offer anything insightful about its subject matter because its so single mindedly stupid about it all the parts about technology philosophy and what it means to be human are all thrown to the wayside and the movie instead grounds most of its logic on the relationship between two people like its the most important thing in this world in a movie where technology is used to heal the sick rebuild the forests and even cure death all the movie wants us to care about is how rebecca hall cannot possibly go on living without her dead husband and how all that amazing wonderful miraclemaking doesnt mean anything im not even sure who the main character is supposed to be depp is in the movie in the flesh only for about 15 minutes and after that he disappears mostly into the background of scenes as a computer program making it hard to relate to him hall acts so selfish stupid and blunt throughout that its impossible to like her as an audience member it certainly isnt paul bettany either hes a prisoner through most of the film and when hes not the things that are happening are more or less out of his control also the vagueness of the films antagonist is a real problem were led to believe that computeriseddepp is the main antagonist but hes not really a computer operating by logic is hard to hate as a viewer because its just doing whats in its own nature and many of the miracles its capable of are not in and of themselves evil either since when was healing the blind considered unjust? it certainly isnt the technoterrorist group rift either their motivations as terrorists isnt even particularly clear other than technology is bad shooting johnny depp over a hypothesis seems more like stupidity than martyrdom also during the films climax they become good guys johnny depp was reportedly paid $20 million for his role in this movie and in my opinion he didnt earn his salary he is stiff lifeless bored thats even before he gets uploaded into a computer and obviously uninterested in the finished product rebecca hall is trying very hard here but the terrible writing of her character hamstring her efforts paul bettany is good here and is probably the films strongest asset but hes not in the film enough and pretty much useless by the time the conclusion comes morgan freeman and cillian murphy are just there they dont really have anything interesting to say or do kate mara gives by far the worst performance the bad writing of her character hurts her more than others but she was impossible to buy as the stern serious leader of an organised terrorist group theres also a huge lack of understanding of rudimentary film making skills at play wally pfister is a gifted cinematographer and the film does look good generally speaking but working cinematography on a movie and directing an entire movie are two completely different ball games many aspects of filmmaking are botched here framing blocking dynamics between characters editing camera movements but especially pacing this is one of the worst paced movies in quite some time nothing that happens in the story has any momentum and this coupled with the poor direction over everything else makes the whole movie completely dull to watch the biggest mistake is that film begins with the ending spoiling any and all tension during the movie im not saying that every movie needs to have an action scene either there isnt a car chase during 12 angry men but transcendence builds to a huge final engagement and when it comes its over with way too quickly its a combination of many elements that could go wrong with a movie and its easy to blame wally pfister for the poor direction but i think this movie represents a far bigger concern johnny depp is currently the highest paid actor in the world but this and some of his last films the lone ranger and dark shadows both had disappointing box office takings which leads me to believe that maybe depps day are numbered andor perhaps were entering a new age of movies where it doesnt matter who you cast a stinkers a stinker and people wont flock to see garbagedont waste your time watching this film every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through i found fascinating the parallel story thats being told between the main character and his daughter at some point nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases the film is a huge contradiction and the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is they are on a mission thats more important than any personal issue man kinds future depends solely on the success of it but f©k that in this kind of hollywood bullshit protagonists cant die just because test audiences dont like that it makes them really really sad so against all odds mcconaughey makes it back home hooray for him and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending mark my words by the time matt damon appears you will be compelled to kick christopher nolan right in the balls i read that they were advised by physicist in order to be scientifically accurate im sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001 event horizon etc interstellar is a cash grab if you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole christopher nolan might have already had his way with you my asshole is intact because i torrented this bad boy suck on that film industrydont waste your

might have already had his way with you my asshole is intact because i torrented this bad boy suck on that film industrydont waste your time and money very bad acting very boring and predictable it just makes no sense i will never ever trust the ratings again ha first hour of the film is so stupid that it is funny faces that actors make unprofessional acting make the movie very very boring what else can i say i wish i stayed home with my husband ben affleck acts like it is his first movie he looks lost looks like he almost forgets the words family members also look and act like people that were taken from the street occasionally all that people look like they have no idea what is the film about im trying to understand how could this goofy movie get those ratings and i guess the answer is money because this is really really low leveldont waste your money too long wanders too much  c script with b actor i felt like i aged 50 years watching this garbage now i know why matthew is doing lincoln commercials he screwed up so many movies and this is what is left his only other worse movie was dumb oops i mean mud  what is this guy thinking whoever wrote this script must have been higher than robert plant in the 70s i cant believe matt damon jumped in probably for beer money matt datmon was the only one worth watching wait until someone hands you the dvd for your library otherwise dont spend a dime on this junk michael caine was in it for the beer money as welldont waste any of your precious time watching this terrible boring and dull film the acting was simply harrowing to watch anne hathaway was as always akin to balsa wood and completely implausible the woman just cant act the film rumbles along for an hour before anything happens by which time you dont really care and you are probably very bored the plot and i use the term loosely is ridiculous and there is more tension in a broken elastic band by watching this i feel like i traded brain cells for jellybeans i must comment on the special effects which i was led to believe were good they were not the script has more holes than a sieve especially when it comes to the scientific theories related to space travel please please dont watch this trashdont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to keep this comment short because i dont want to spend more time of my life for this movie almost three hours was enough on the other side the movie made me feel better about myself in some way i mean some people spent 12 years making this what a waste this was refreshing because they lost more of their life than me this long production time doesnt show itself in the quality i had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality they used the style of bad propaganda movies typical suburban shots where you expect that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children of course it would be explained too why it is bad like everything else in this movie they put the words in your mouth leaving nothing for the imagination i dont even mention that the main character is not special at all even more boring than an average person oh and he makes bad quality photos too in this bad quality movie living the life of an artist in a movie which never heard of art and he leaves his picture in the developer for waaay to long listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead you will find all kinds of schemes and clichs in this piece of modern film history as they call it in this movie which doesnt dare to state anything the whole movie was like a 3 hours long idk showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming whitetrash is promarijuana i guess but only daring to show it for a split of a second i watched every second of this movie just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? with a highly unrealistic chick acting like a dateraper sitting with our high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont knowdont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to keep this comment short because i dont want to spend more time

repeating the concept of this film i dont knowdoes highly paid cast means good movie? the high rating of this movie represents the biased minds of reviewers towards famous cast it certainly does not deserve 72 rating twilight series which i really hated was better than this this movie is a piece of epic failure and is undoubtedly one of worst movies of this years to date there was no such thing even close to what we call good acting the movie was unable to develop any interest during whole of its running time i kept guessing there might be some twist or action coming up because of the high ratings but i was left with an anger that i wasted my time it is clear to me now that angelina jolie lacks voice talent she does not have any face expressions and most of her movies are overrated 2 stars for a slightly better graphics movie lovers avoid it not recommended to anybodydo not believe the reviews this does not come close to an all time great movie i really question someone that gives this movie a good review its completely too long and filled with holes in noway does it come close to connecting any dots the only reason i went to see this movie is because of the 91 rating at the time but my first instinct was correct this movie is not worth watching ever maybe if they shaved 1 hour off but as is stay away after watching this movie i felt compelled to open an imdb account and review my first movie ever because of these reviews that are complete nonsensedid i see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote?? probably not the movie doesnt give any logic explanation to anything everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial possible way to not get completely disappointed all through the movie you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you wont get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind also great actors like matthew mcconaughey are acting awfully probably realizing they are acting in a dumb movie all the director is trying to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects probably realizing himself how poor the plot is how could so many good actors accept to work in such a poor movie? and how come so many critics are writing that this is a great movie? i would really like to know what great directors like scorsese di palma herzog spielberg would think about this movie in two words absolutely disappointingdespite the hype i went to see interstellar hoping for the best from the dreadful opening which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in space clearly an homage to kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than todays filmmakers the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired redemptive spacetime scenes but oh that insipid dialogue and mcconaughys western drawl and baleful looks echoed by a truly wasted anne hathaway who also walked through her lines the real culprit is the editing as if nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene and the music? so banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time i couldnt wait for the space scenes to begin but from liftoff to deep space they could have nasa footage instead i just cant imagine how anyone could call the space scenes thrilling or the twists and turns of the plot gripping whether or not you liked gravity at least its space scenes were in your face and hardedged watching the interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a cracker jacks box was simply embarrassing the scene of mcconaughy and hathaway begging mat damon not to activate the airlock because it wasnt sealed was just another example of nolan trying to manufacture excitement instead of being a hoped for surprise the result was not only something we have seen in many scifi space movies but as an experienced astronaut and pilot damons character would absolutely know would happen there were so many wooden moments its hard to count the best was when mcconaughy walks into his sisters hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero not even a cocked head what a colossal waste of time talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable you just cant create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it nolan may have had a good story in his head but what a messconfused poorly plotted no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs 1 out of 10 and thats being kinddespite as far as i recall the first movie being pretty good insurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an unsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power the movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have predicted and is generally lackluster in its dialog with a weak plot boring characters and a total disregard for all character development from the first movie this was an extreme disappointment for me i will admit there were some good scenes but a diamond smothered in cow manure isnt very attractive the bottom line is that i didnt connect with any of the characters i dont know if this is the case but it seemed like they were trying to fit a lot of things from the book in that didnt belong the plot jumped all over the place without getting to know the characters in the plot or subplots i just got out of the movie and i can only remember three of the characters namesdear santa could you please please please arrange to make it possible that i never have to sit through another execrable pile of utter garbage that has become the standard level of effluvium nolan seems to regularly pitch out all dressed up in its sparkly emperors new clothes? memento was astonishingly brilliant on a budget of several shillings insomnia likewise batman begins was a welcome reinvigoration of a franchise which had previously become something to ridicule and then came the seriously big budgets which exponentially reduced the credibility of any plot or story and here we are at a new cinematic low which worryingly garners this level of praise presumably because it has big special effects empty shallow bombastic unengaging risible crap ohand a new train set would be tops thanksconvoluted dialogue wooden performances and a surprise to see zoe saldana and particularly glenn close in such dross i can only surmise they needed the moneyno character development to speak of except for that of the raccoon that cgid fellow actually showed more acting chops and skill than any of the human cast im a huge fan of marvel and its always a shame to see a thing done badly there was no energy the pace was laboured staggered it just lacked rhythm as a side note the rating this film has received is a travesty i must assume people are not watching movies they are rating i understand everyones tastes are different but really 8 stars i wouldnt by the dvd wait until it hits terrestrial if you must see it but definitely dont pay good money to view this filmcons i hated how the actor for cinderella looked her eyebrows bothered me throughout the whole movieshe wasnt a true blond had a fat jaw small eyes larger nose and bluntly just not gorgeous cinderella was supposed to be pretty with all small facial features except for big blue eyes her eyes were not even bluetheres plenty of beautiful blonde actors like amanda seyfried amber laura heardanna sophia robbchloâ grace moretzindiana rose evansand her not having her hair in a bun with earing and gloves really just helped destroy the whole cinderella look the step sisters were supposed to be overweight and ugly but both were skinny and one pretty the child cinderella had buck teeth and a big nose and forehead too and wasnt too pretty either theres the step mom didnt seem so evil more hurt and greedy but not consistent with either the movie wasnt too exciting or dramatizedpros the change in how she got her name was great her being couragous and kind was good the men that actually looked like a goose and lizards was great the carriage blue dress and glass slipper was magical the price was perfectthe real mom was perfect and beautiful the acting from most actors was goodthe moral of the story was better and last but not least disney make a movie with a hispanic girl theres mostly white princess and only a few non white that are never displayed on shirts and etc except for the occasional black princess to shut people upthis is quite possibly the worst movie ever made not funny just stupid worse than bill and teds bogus journey worse than anything ever except maybe natural born killers they both were horrid i can not believe that anyone could enjoy this movie i guess if i were on crack it might be mildly funny but i doubt it i was expecting much more for the acting considering that there are some good actors in it they must have decided to see how bad they could make something and still get people to watch it there is no other logical explanation for why they would be a part of such a stupid movie
